"resolving the w-boson mass in the lepton specific two higgs doublet
  model","In this study, the parameter space of the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet
Model (LS-2HDM) is investigated to align the W-boson mass reported by the CDF
experiment with recent theoretical and experimental findings. The Lepton
Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model, a distinguished category within Two Higgs
Doublet Models, contains two CP-even, one CP-odd, and two charged scalar
bosons, which play crucial role in estimating W boson mass. First, constraints
from diverse experimental data, including ATLAS 13 TeV analyses, rare B-meson
decays, and Lepton Flavor Universality in tau-lepton and Z-boson decays, are
determined and imposed on the parameter space of the model. These constraints
are subsequently applied to potential solutions generated through random scans
using SARAH 4.13.0 and analyzed using SPheno 4.0.3. The analysis indicates the
possibility of realizing the CDF-reported W-boson mass up to $1\sigma$ within
the low $\tan\beta$ regime ($2.5 \lesssim \tan\beta \lesssim 8.0 $).
Furthermore, it establishes mass limits for the additional scalar boson as $164
\lesssim m_{h_2} \lesssim 195 $ GeV, $330 \lesssim m_{A} \lesssim 575 $ GeV,
and $345 \lesssim m_{H^\pm} \lesssim 685 $ GeV. Moreover, it is observed that
instead of the masses, mass differences of the new scalars of the model are
more constrained to assure the CDF reported value of the W boson. Finally, all
potential solutions estimating the W-boson mass within a $1\sigma$ vicinity are
rigorously tested using the HiggsTools package. Remarkably, only one solution
remains valid, estimating $M_W=80.4103$ GeV within a $2.44\sigma$ vicinity of
the CDF-reported value.","{'Huseyin Dag', 'Ali Cici'}",2024-03-16T10:47:13Z,2024-03-16 10:47:13+00:00
"interpreting 95 gev di-photon/$b\bar{b}$ excesses as a lightest higgs
  boson of the mrssm","The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM) is a well
motivated BSM model which can accommodate the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson in
agreement with electroweak precision observables, in particular with the $W$
boson mass and $T$ parameter. In the 2016 paper we showed that the SM-like 125
GeV Higgs state can be also realised as the second-to-lightest scalar of the
MRSSM, leaving room for another sub-100 GeV state. Motivated by the recent
ATLAS and CMS observation of the di-photon excess at a mass of around 95 GeV we
investigate the possibility whether this could be the lightest CP-even MRSSM
scalar in a variation of our benchmarks presented in the 2016 work. We show
that such a state can also simultaneously explain the excess in the $b\bar{b}$
final state observed around the same mass value at LEP. Due to the R-symmetric
nature of the model, a light singlet-like Higgs state leads necessarily to a
light bino-singlino Dirac dark matter candidate, which can give a correct relic
density while evading current experimental bounds. Dark matter and LHC searches
place further bounds on this scenario and point to parameter regions which are
viable and of interest for the LHC Run III and upcoming dark matter
experiments.","{'Jan Kalinowski', 'Wojciech Kotlarski'}",2024-03-13T17:19:54Z,2024-03-13 17:19:54+00:00

also investigated. Our results are in good agreement with the recent ATLAS

small systems.","{'Jia-Lin Pei', 'Guo-Liang Ma', 'Adam Bzdak'}",2024-03-09T03:31:22Z,2024-03-09 03:31:22+00:00
the quest to discover supersymmetry at the atlas experiment,"The search for supersymmetry with the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider intensified after the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The
search programme expanded in both breadth and depth, profiting from the
increased integrated luminosity and higher centre-of-mass energy of Run 2, and
gaining new sensitivity to unexplored areas of supersymmetry parameter space
through the use of new experimental signatures and innovative analysis
techniques. This report summarises the supersymmetry searches at ATLAS using up
to 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, including the
limits set on the production of gluinos, squarks, and electroweakinos for

"unified interpretation of muon g-2 anomaly, 95 gev diphoton, and
  $b\bar{b}$ excesses in the general next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard
  model","We investigate three intriguing anomalies within the framework of the General
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. These anomalies include a
significant deviation of the experimental results for the muon anomalous
magnetic moment from its Standard Model prediction, with a confidence level of
$5.1\sigma$; a joint observation by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations of a
diphoton excess with a local significance of $3.1 \sigma$ in the invariant mass
distribution around 95.4 GeV; and a reported excess in the $b\bar{b}$
production at LEP with a local significance of $2.3 \sigma$. Through analytical
and numerical analyses, we provide unified interpretations across an extensive
parameter space that remain consistent with current experimental restrictions
from data on the Higgs boson at 125 GeV, B-physics measurements, dark matter
observables, as well as existing searches for supersymmetry and extra Higgs
bosons. We attribute the muon anomaly to loops involving muon-smuon-neutralino
and muon-sneutrino-chargino interactions, while attributing the diphoton and $b
\bar{b}$ excesses to the resonant production of a singlet-dominated scalar.
These proposed solutions are poised for experimental tests at the

tasks, prompting their exploration for the generation of calorimeter responses.
Given the computational challenges posed by detector simulations in high-energy
physics experiments, the necessity to explore new machine-learning-based
approaches is evident. This study introduces a novel graph-based diffusion
model designed specifically for rapid calorimeter simulations. The methodology
is particularly well-suited for low-granularity detectors featuring irregular

unitarity effects in elastic scattering at the lhc,"We study the high-energy behavior of the elastic scattering amplitude using
two distinct unitarization schemes: the eikonal and the $U$-matrix. Our
analysis begins with a formalism involving solely Pomerons, incorporating
pion-loop insertions in the Pomeron trajectory representing the nearest
singularity generated by $t$-channel unitarity. Subsequently, we explore a
scenario that includes the presence of an Odderon. In our analyses, we explore
the tension between the TOTEM and the ATLAS measurements for $\sigma_{tot}$ and
$d\sigma/dt$ at 7, 8, and 13 TeV, and the subsequent implications for the
properties of both the Pomeron and Odderon. Our results show that the Odderon
phase factor $\xi_{\Bbb O}= -1$ is favored in both unitarization schemes. More
interestingly, this specific phase factor stands as the sole one that aligns
with results consistent with a non-zero Odderon coupling.","{'M. Maneyro', 'M. Pel√°ez', 'E. G. S. Luna'}",2024-02-17T21:35:44Z,2024-02-17 21:35:44+00:00
"interpretations of the atlas measurements of higgs boson production and
  decay rates and differential cross-sections in $pp$ collisions at
  $\sqrt{s}=13$ tev","Measurements of the Higgs boson production times decay rates and differential
cross-sections have recently been performed by the ATLAS experiment in several
decay channels using up to 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at
$\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded at the Large Hadron Collider. This paper presents
multiple interpretations of these Higgs boson measurements. Measurements of
production-mode cross-sections, simplified template cross-sections and fiducial
differential cross-sections in different decay channels are reparameterised in
terms of the impact of Standard Model effective field theory operators, and
constraints are reported on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. Production
and decay rate measurements are interpreted in UV-complete extensions of the
Standard Model, namely the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) near thealignment
limit and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) for various MSSM
benchmark scenarios. The constraints on the 2HDM parameters
$(\cos(\beta-\alpha), \tan\beta)$ and the MSSM parameters $(m_A, \tan\beta)$
are complementary to those obtained from direct searches for additional Higgs

"accommodating the lhc charged higgs boson excess at 130 gev in the
  general two-higgs doublet model","Charged Higgs bosons are common predictions in most extensions of the
Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector. Therefore, their observation would elucidate
the nature of the Higgs sector. Motivated by the ATLAS collaboration's latest
analysis performed with $139~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of Run 2 data intended to search
for charged Higgs boson, produced in top quark decay and subsequently decaying
via $H^\pm \rightarrow cb$, where an excess with a local significance of
$3\sigma$ is observed at $m_{H^\pm} = 130~\rm{GeV}$, we discuss here the
possibility of explaining such excess in the context of the general 2-Higgs
Doublet Model (2HDM type-III), after satisfying all theoretical and up-to-date
experimental constraints. We also propose phenomenological scenarios to further
explore the mass region around 130 GeV in the four Yukawa types of the 2HDM
type-III and suggest alternative decay channel $H^\pm \rightarrow cs$ and/or
$H^\pm \rightarrow W^{\pm *}h$ to probe the nature of the observed excess (if
it is not a statistical fluctuation). Future searches for $H^\pm$ will be
critical in confirming or refuting the first hint of a light charged Higgs
boson at the LHC.","{'Souad Semlali', 'Mohamed Krab', 'Abdesslam Arhrib'}",2024-02-12T08:30:07Z,2024-02-05 17:00:48+00:00

combined analysis based on the experimental signal strengths used in this work
and the theoretical ones elaborated for our analysis reliably reproduce the
results in the literature. We reveal that the LHC Higgs precision data are no
longer best described by the SM Higgs boson taking account of extensive and
comprehensive CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios found in several
well-motivated models beyond the SM. Especially, in most of the fits considered
in this work, we observe that the best-fitted values of the normalized Yukawa
couplings are about $2\sigma$ below the corresponding SM ones with the
$1\sigma$ errors of 3-5%. On the other hand, the gauge-Higgs couplings are
consistent with the SM with the $1\sigma$ errors of 2-3%. Incidentally, the

"atlas run 2 searches for electroweak production of supersymmetric
  particles interpreted within the pmssm","A summary of the constraints from searches performed by the ATLAS
Collaboration for the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos is
presented. Results from eight separate ATLAS searches are considered, each
using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton data at a centre-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV collected at the Large Hadron Collider during its second
data-taking run. The results are interpreted in the context of the 19-parameter
phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model, where R-parity
conservation is assumed and the lightest supersymmetric particle is assumed to
be the lightest neutralino. Constraints from previous electroweak, flavour and
dark matter related measurements are also considered. The results are presented
in terms of constraints on supersymmetric particle masses and are compared with
limits from simplified models. Also shown is the impact of ATLAS searches on
parameters such as the dark matter relic density and the spin-dependent and
spin-independent scattering cross-sections targeted by direct dark matter
detection experiments. The Higgs boson and Z boson `funnel regions', where a
low-mass neutralino would not oversaturate the dark matter relic abundance, are
almost completely excluded by the considered constraints. Example spectra for
non-excluded supersymmetric models with light charginos and neutralinos are
also presented.",{'ATLAS Collaboration'},2024-02-02T13:15:48Z,2024-02-02 13:15:48+00:00

"explaining the $Œ≥Œ≥+x$ excesses at $\approx$151.5 gev via the
  drell-yan production of a higgs triplet","The multi-lepton anomalies and searches for the associated production of a
narrow resonance indicate the existence of a $\approx$151 GeV Higgs with a
significance of $>5\sigma$ and $>3.9\sigma$, respectively. On the one hand,
these anomalies require a sizable branching fraction of the new scalar to $WW$,
while on the other hand, no $ZZ$ signal at this mass has been observed. This
suggests that the new boson is the neutral component of an $SU(2)_L$ triplet
with zero hypercharge. This field leads to a positive definite shift in the $W$
mass, as preferred by the current global fit, and is produced via the Drell-Yan
process $pp\to W^*\to \Delta^0\Delta^\pm$. We use the side-bands of the ATLAS
analysis \cite{ATLAS:2023omk} of the associated production of the Standard
Model Higgs in the di-photon channel to search for this production mode of the
triplet. Since the dominant decays of $\Delta^\pm$ depend only on its mass, the
effect in the 22 signal categories considered by ATLAS is completely
correlated. We find that the ones most sensitive to the Drell-Yan production of
the triplet Higgs show consistent excesses at a mass of $\approx$151.5 GeV.
Combining these channels in a likelihood ratio test, a non-zero
Br$[\Delta^0\to\gamma\gamma] = 0.66\%$ is preferred by $\approx$3$\sigma$,

bottomonium suppression in 5.02 and 8.16 tev p-pb collisions,"We compute the suppression of Upsilon(1S), Upsilon(2S), and Upsilon(3S)
states in p-Pb collisions relative to pp collisions, including nuclear parton
distribution function (nPDF) effects, coherent energy loss, momentum
broadening, and final-state interactions in the quark-gluon plasma. We employ
the EPPS21 nPDFs and calculate the uncertainty resulting from variation over
the associated error sets. To compute coherent energy loss and momentum
broadening, we follow the approach of Arleo, Peigne, and collaborators. The
3+1D viscous hydrodynamical background evolution of the quark-gluon plasma is
generated by anisotropic hydrodynamics. The in-medium suppression of
bottomonium in the quark-gluon plasma is computed using a next-to-leading-order
open quantum system framework formulated within potential nonrelativistic
quantum chromodynamics. We find that inclusion of all these effects provides a
reasonable description of experimental data from the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and

Upsilon(3S) as a function of both transverse momentum and rapidity.","{'Sabin Thapa', 'Ramona Vogt', 'Michael Strickland'}",2024-01-30T03:07:39Z,2024-01-30 03:07:39+00:00
"detecting highly collimated photon-jets from higgs boson exotic decays
  with deep learning","Recently, there has been a growing focus on the search for anomalous objects
beyond standard model (BSM) signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This
study investigates novel signatures involving highly collimated photons,
referred to as photon-jets. These photon-jets can be generated from highly
boosted BSM particles that decay into two or more collimated photons in the
final state. Since these photons cannot be isolated from each other, they are
treated as a single jet-like object rather than a multi-photon signature. The
Higgs portal model is utilized as a prototype for studying photon-jet
signatures. Specifically, GEANT4 is employed to simulate electromagnetic
showers in an ATLAS-like electromagnetic calorimeter, and three machine
learning techniques: Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), and Particle Flow Networks (PFN) are applied to effectively
distinguish these photon-jet signatures from single photons and neutral pions
within the SM backgrounds. Our models attain an identification efficiency
exceeding $99\%$ for photon-jets, coupled with a rejection rate surpassing
$99\%$ for SM backgrounds. Furthermore, the sensitivities for searching

transverse momentum balance of dijets in xe+xe collisions at the lhc,"We present a theoretical study of the medium modifications on the $p_{\rm T}$
balance ($x_{\rm J}$) of dijets in Xe+Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.44$
TeV. The initial production of dijets is carried out by the POWHEG+PYTHIA8
prescription, which matches the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD matrix elements
with the parton shower (PS) effect. The in-medium evolution in nucleus-nucleus
collisions is described by the SHELL model with a transport approach. The
theoretical results of the dijet $x_{\rm J}$ in Xe+Xe collisions exhibit more
imbalanced distributions than that in p+p, consistent with the recently
reported ATLAS data. By utilizing the Interleaved Flavor Neutralisation, an
infrared-and-collinear-safe jet flavor algorithm, to identify the flavor of the
reconstructed jets, we classify dijets processes into three categories:
gluon-gluon ($gg$), quark-gluon ($qg$) and quark-quark ($qq$), and investigate
the respective medium modification patterns and fraction changes of the $gg$,
$qg$, and $qq$ components of the dijet sample in Xe+Xe collisions. It is shown
that the $qg$ component plays a key role in the increased imbalance of the
dijet $x_{\rm J}$, and especially the $q_1g_2$ (quark-jet-leading) dijets
experience more significant asymmetric energy loss than the $g_1q_2$
(gluon-jet-leading) dijets as traversing the QGP. By comparing the $\Delta
\langle x_{\rm J}\rangle$ of inclusive, $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ dijets in
Xe+Xe collisions, we observe $\Delta \langle x_{\rm J} \rangle_{\rm
incl.}>\Delta \langle x_{\rm J} \rangle_{\rm c\bar{c}}>\Delta \langle x_{\rm J}
\rangle_{\rm b\bar{b}}$. Moreover, $\rho_{\rm Xe, Pb}$, the ratios of nuclear
modification factors of dijets in Xe+Xe to that in Pb+Pb, are calcualted, which
indicates that the yield suppression of dijets in Pb+Pb is more pronounced than
that in Xe+Xe due to the larger radius of the lead nucleus.","{'Shuwan Shen', 'Sa Wang', 'Ben-Wei Zhang', 'Yao Li'}",2024-01-03T12:17:24Z,2024-01-03 12:17:24+00:00
"explanation of the 95 gev $Œ≥Œ≥$ and $b\bar{b}$ excesses in the

both CMS and ATLAS groups at 95 GeV together with the LEP excess in the
$Zb\bar{b}$ channel around the same mass in terms of a neutral scalar field in
the minimal left-right symmetric model (LRSM). We point out that the scalar
field which implements the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses has all the
right properties to explain these observations, without introducing any extra
scalar fields. The key point is that this scalar particle is hardly constrained
because it couples only to heavy right-handed particles. As a result, the
diphoton decay mode receives contributions from both mixing with the Standard
Model (SM) Higgs and the heavy charged bosons in the LRSM, depending on the
$SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking scale $v_R$. The complete allowed

both ATLAS and CMS reported elevated four-top and ttW cross-sections. In this
article, we propose a combined explanation of these excesses by supplementing
the SM Higgs with a second scalar doublet, a real scalar singlet ($S$) and a
Higgs triplet with $Y=0$ ($\Delta$); the $\Delta$2HDMS. We fix the masses of
the neutral triplet-like and the singlet-like scalars by the di-photon
excesses, i.e. $m_{\Delta^0}=152$GeV and $m_S=95$GeV, respectively. Here, H,
the CP-even component of the second doublet, is produced via gluon fusion from
a top-loop and decays dominantly to $S+\Delta^0$ whose subsequent decays to WW
and bb explain the differential top-quark distributions for $\sigma(pp\to H\to
S\Delta^0)\approx6$pb. Fixing the top-Yukawa accordingly, the CP-odd Higgs
boson A turns out to have the right production cross-section to account for the
resonant top-pair excess at 400GeV, while the top-associated production of H
and A results in new physics pollution of Standard Model ttW and four-top cross
sections, as preferred by the data. Furthermore, a positive shift in the W mass
is naturally induced by the vacuum expectation value of the triplet and we show
that the most relevant signal strengths of the 152GeV boson are compatible with
the process $pp\to H\to \Delta^0S$ if S is allowed to decay invisibly.","{'Bruce Mellado', 'Andreas Crivellin', 'Guglielmo Coloretti'}",2023-12-28T19:00:00Z,2023-12-28 19:00:00+00:00
light-by-light scattering at next-to-leading order in qcd and qed,"The recent experimental observation of Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering at the
Large Hadron Collider has revived interest in this fundamental process, and
especially of the accurate prediction of its cross-section, which we present
here for the first time at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in both QCD and QED. We
compare two radically different computational approaches, both exact in the
fermion mass dependence, thus offering a strong cross-check of our results. The
first approach is a fully analytic method to calculate compact and
well-organized two-loop helicity amplitudes. The second one is entirely
numerical and leverages the Local Unitarity construction. Our two calculations
agree with each other and conclude that including the exact fermion mass
contribution typically increases the size of the NLO corrections. Moreover, we
find that the exact result converges slowly to the massless limit of the
high-energy regime, thus emphasizing the importance of including the full mass
dependence at NLO. We also compare our results with the ATLAS measurement of
LbL in ultra-peripheral lead-lead collisions, and find that the inclusion of
exact NLO corrections reduces, but does not eliminate, the existing tension
with theoretical predictions.","{'Hua-Sheng Shao', 'Ajjath A H', 'Ekta Chaubey', 'Mathijs Fraaije', 'Valentin Hirschi'}",2024-03-10T20:10:12Z,2023-12-28 11:00:15+00:00
global lhc constraints on electroweak-inos with smodels v2.3,"Electroweak-inos, superpartners of the electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons,
play a special role in supersymmetric theories. Their intricate mixing into
chargino and neutralino mass eigenstates leads to a rich phenomenology, which
makes it difficult to derive generic limits from LHC data. In this paper, we
present a global analysis of LHC constraints for promptly decaying
electroweak-inos in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model,
exploiting the SModelS software package. Combining up to 16 ATLAS and CMS
searches for which electroweak-ino efficiency maps are available in SModelS, we
study which combinations maximise the sensitivity in different regions of the
parameter space, how fluctuations in the data in individual analyses influence
the global likelihood, and what is the resulting exclusion power of the
combination compared to the analysis-by-analysis approach.","{'Th√©o Reymermier', 'Wolfgang Waltenberger', 'Sabine Kraml', 'Timoth√©e Pascal', 'Sahana Narasimha', 'Andre Lessa', 'Mohammad Mahdi Altakach'}",2024-03-08T16:49:33Z,2023-12-27 16:40:45+00:00
a 95 gev higgs boson in the georgi-machacek model,"CMS and ATLAS have reported small excesses in the search for low-mass Higgs
bosons in the di-photon decay channel at exactly the same mass, $95.4~$GeV.
These searches rely on improved analysis techniques, enhancing in particular
the discrimination against the $Z \to e^+e^-$ background. In models beyond the
Standard Model (SM) that extend the Higgs sector with triplets, doubly-charged
Higgs bosons are predicted which can contribute substantially to the di-photon
decay rate of a light Higgs boson. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) Model is of
particular interest in this context, since despite containing Higgs triplets it
preserves the electroweak $\rho$-parameter to be$~$1 at the tree level. We show
that within the GM model, a Higgs boson with a mass of $\sim 95~$GeV with a
di-photon decay rate as observed by CMS and ATLAS can be well described. We
discuss the di-photon excess in conjunction with an excess in the $b \bar b$
final state observed at LEP and an excess observed by CMS in the di-tau final
state, which have been found at comparable masses with local significances of
about $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$, respectively. The presence of a Higgs boson at
about $95~$GeV within the GM model would imply good prospects of the searches
for additional light Higgs bosons. In particular, the observed excess in the
di-photon channel would be expected to be correlated in the GM model with a
light doubly-charged Higgs boson in the mass range between $100~$GeV and
$200~$GeV, which motivates dedicated searches in upcoming LHC Runs.","{'Cheng-Wei Chiang', 'Ting-Kuo Chen', 'Georg Weiglein', 'Sven Heinemeyer'}",2023-12-20T18:06:56Z,2023-12-20 18:06:56+00:00

"the impact of lhc jet and $z$ $p_t$ data at up to approximate n${}^3$lo
  order in the msht global pdf fit","We present an analysis of two key sets of data constraining the high $x$
gluon at up to approximate N${}^3$LO in QCD within the MSHT global PDF fitting
framework. We begin with LHC 7 and 8 TeV inclusive jet and dijet production at
both NNLO and aN${}^3$LO. This makes use of the formalism established in the
previous global MSHT20aN${}^3$LO PDF fit, but now considers the role of dijet
production for the first time at this order. We present a detailed comparison
of the fit quality and PDF impact for both cases, and consider the role that
electroweak corrections, and the scale choice for inclusive jet production has.
Some mild tension between these data sets in the impact on the high $x$ gluon
is seen at NNLO, but this is largely eliminated at aN${}^3$LO. While a good fit
quality to the dijet data is achieved at both orders, the fit quality to the
inclusive jet data is relatively poor. We examine the impact of including full
colour corrections in a global PDF fit for the first time, finding this to be
relatively mild. We also revisit the fit to the ATLAS 8 TeV $Z$ $p_T$ data,
considering the role that the $p_T$ cuts, data selection and different aspects
of the aN${}^3$LO treatment have on the fit quality and PDF impact. We observe
that in all cases the aN${}^3$LO fit quality is consistently improved relative
to the NNLO, indicating a clear preference for higher order theory for these
data.","{'T. Cridge', 'L. A. Harland-Lang', 'R. S. Thorne'}",2023-12-19T19:00:01Z,2023-12-19 19:00:01+00:00

interference between the process $gg\! \to \! H \! \to \! Z \gamma$ induced by
loops of heavy particles, which is by far the dominant contribution to the
signal, and the continuum $gg \to Z \gamma$ QCD background process mediated by
light quark loops. This interference modifies the event yield, the resonance
line-shape and the apparent mass of the Higgs boson. We calculate the radiative
corrections to this interference beyond the leading-order approximation in
perturbative QCD and find that, while differing numerically from the
corresponding effects on the more studied $gg \! \to \! \gamma \gamma$ signal,
they are generally rather small. As such, they do not impact significantly the
interpretation of the present measurements of the $H \to Z \gamma$ decay mode.","{'Federica Devoto', 'Lorenzo Tancredi', 'Federico Buccioni', 'J√©r√©mie Quevillon', 'Abdelhak Djouadi', 'John Ellis'}",2023-12-19T18:18:41Z,2023-12-19 18:18:41+00:00
"fully-heavy hadronic molecules $b_c^{(*)+} b_c^{(*)-}$ bound by
  fully-heavy mesons","A lot of exotic hadrons were reported in the past twenty years, which bring
us the renaissance of the hadron spectroscopy. Most of them can be understood
as hadronic molecules, whose interactions are mainly due to the exchange of
light mesons, and specifically, light vector mesons through the coupled-channel
unitary approach within the local hidden-gauge formalism. It is still
controversial whether the interaction arising from the exchange of heavy mesons
is capable of forming hadronic molecules. We apply the coupled-channel unitary
approach to study the fully-heavy $b \bar b c \bar c$ system, where the
exchanged mesons can only be the fully-heavy vector mesons $J/\psi$, $B_c^*$,
and $\Upsilon$. Especially, the $J/\psi$ meson is much lighter than the
$B_c^{(*)}$ mesons, so the present study can be taken as a general
investigation on the question whether a lower-mass fully-heavy meson is able to
bind two higher-mass fully-heavy hadrons. Our results suggest the existence of
the fully-heavy hadronic molecules $|B_c^{+} B_c^{-}; J^{PC}=0^{++} \rangle$,
$|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} - c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{+-} \rangle$, and $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{*-};
J^{PC}=2^{++} \rangle$ as well as the possible existence of $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-}

hadronic decay of exotic mesons consisting of four charm quarks,"In 2020, a di-$J/\psi$ resonance centered at around 6.9 $\mathrm{GeV}$ was
discovered by the LHCb Collaboration, and was later confirmed by the ATLAS and
CMS Collaborations. In addition to the 6.9-$\mathrm{GeV}$ resonance, its low
energy counterpart centered at around 6552 $\mathrm{MeV}$ was also observed by
the CMS Collaboration. In this paper, we calculate the inclusive decay width of
such exotic mesons into light hadrons and into open charms, respectively,
assuming them as either genuine tetraquarks or molecules composed of two
$J/\psi$'s. Since the spins of these resonances have not yet been
experimentally measured, regarding them as S-wave bound states, we consider all
possible spin configurations, namely spin-0 and spin-2, that decay exclusively
into double $J/\psi$, and find that the ratio ($\mathcal{R}$) of the decay
width for the light-hadron final states to that for the charmed final states
differs significantly among different spin configurations, which can help to
explore the nature of the observed di-$J/\psi$ resonances and fix the mixing
angle for the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ tetraquark.","{'Xue-Mei Mo', 'Yu-Peng Yan', 'Hong-Fei Zhang'}",2023-12-17T23:56:45Z,2023-12-17 23:56:45+00:00

of providing high-energy and high-luminosity leptonic collisions among future
lepton-lepton particle accelerators. In addition, it provides significantly
cleaner final states than those produced in hadron collisions. With this

dependence of the parameters of the model is determined and analyzed. The
L\'evy $\alpha$ parameter of the model has an energy-independent value of 1.959
$\pm$ 0.002 following from the strong non-exponential behavior of the data. We
strengthen the conclusion that the discrepancy between TOTEM and ATLAS elastic

and not in the shape of the distribution of the data as a function of $t$. We
find that the slope parameter has different values for $pp$ and $p\bar p$

going beyond top eft,"We present a new way to interpret Top Standard Model measurements going
beyond the SMEFT framework. Instead of the usual paradigm in Top EFT, where the
main effects come from tails in momenta distributions, we propose an
interpretation in terms of new physics which only shows up at loop-level. The
effects of these new states, which can be lighter than required within the
SMEFT, appear as distinctive structures at high momenta, but may be suppressed
at the tails of distributions. As an illustration of this phenomena, we present
the explicit case of a UV model with a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, including a
Dark Matter candidate and a top-partner. This simple UV model reproduces the
main features of this class of signatures, particularly a momentum-dependent
form factor with more structure than the SMEFT. As the new states can be
lighter than in SMEFT, we explore the interplay between the reinterpretation of
direct searches for colored states and Dark Matter, and Top measurements made
by ATLAS and CMS in the differential $t \bar t$ final state. We also compare
our method with what one would expect using the SMEFT reinterpretation, finding
that using the full loop information provides a better discriminating power.","{'Ver√≥nica Sanz', 'Andr√© Lessa'}",2023-12-01T15:49:20Z,2023-12-01 15:49:20+00:00

delayed, non-pointing photons can constrain the model. In this work, we carry

monojets reveal overlapping excesses for light compressed higgsinos,"The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have recently presented results of searches
for compressed electroweakinos in final states including soft leptons. These
searches are sensitive to mass splittings ranging from quite small values of
about 5 GeV to O(10) GeV, which are endemic to scenarios with wino-like and
higgsino-like lightest supersymmetric particles (LSPs). While all experimental
results exhibit apparently compatible mild excesses, these soft-lepton
analyses, taken together with disappearing-track searches targeting much
smaller splittings, notably leave unconstrained a sizeable region of parameter
space with modest splittings of 1-5 GeV. We point out that this gap can be
closed, for scenarios with a higgsino-like LSP, by existing monojet searches.
On the other hand, we find at the same time that these monojet searches show
excesses in precisely the region favoured by the soft-lepton analyses. We
provide an up-to-date map of these results and show, among others, a best-fit
point with a global excess greater than $2\sigma$ that is consistent with a
higgsino-like LSP mass around 133 GeV. We finally comment on how such a point

interpretations, with a particular focus on identifying whether quarks or
diquarks are the most relevant degrees of freedom. Our preferred scenario is
that $X(6600)$ and its apparent partner state $X(6400)$ are the tensor

Additionally, we give predictions for relations among decay branching fractions

"prospects for measuring quark polarization and spin correlations in

at the LHC, but have been explored very little for the other flavors of quarks.
In this paper we consider the processes $pp\to q\bar{q}$ with $q = b$, $c$ or
$s$. Utilizing the partial preservation of the quark's spin information in
baryons in the jet produced by the quark, we examine possible analysis
strategies for ATLAS and CMS to measure the quark polarization and spin
correlations. We find polarization measurements for the $b$ and $c$ quarks to
be feasible, even with the currently available datasets. Spin correlation
measurements for $b\bar b$ are possible using the CMS Run 2 parked data, while
such measurements for $c\bar c$ will become possible with higher integrated
luminosity. For the $s$ quark, we find the measurements to be challenging with
the standard triggers. We also provide leading-order QCD predictions for the
polarization and spin correlations expected in the $b\bar b$ and $c\bar c$
samples with the cuts envisioned for the above analyses. Apart from
establishing experimentally the existence of spin correlations in $b\bar b$ and
$c\bar c$ systems produced in $pp$ collisions, the proposed measurements can
provide new information on the polarization transfer from quarks to baryons and
might even be sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model.","{'Yevgeny Kats', 'David Uzan'}",2024-03-07T13:16:39Z,2023-11-14 15:06:59+00:00

We take several state-of-the-art parton distribution functions (PDFs) as input
for the fit and evaluate their associated uncertainties, as well as the
uncertainties arising from renormalization and factorization scale variation.
Fit uncertainties related to the datasets are also part of the extracted
uncertainty of the top-quark mass and turn out to be of similar size as the
combined scale and PDF uncertainty. Fit results from different PDF sets agree
among each other within 1$\sigma$ uncertainty, whereas some datasets related to
$t\bar{t}$ decay in different channels (dileptonic vs. semileptonic) point
towards top-quark mass values in slight tension among each other, although
still compatible within $2.5 \sigma$ accuracy. Our results are compatible with
the PDG 2022 top-quark pole-mass value. Our work opens the road towards more
complex simultaneous NNLO fits of PDFs, the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ and
the top-quark mass, using the currently most precise experimental data on

  ${e\!\!/}_{t}$ and precise measurement of top quark features at the lhc","Till today, although the Standard Model (SM) is the most celebrated theory
that explains nature almost completely, there are still some phenomena observed
in nature that the SM cannot explain. That is why it is needed to look for
theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM). While the ATLAS/CMS experiments
discovered a Standard Model-like Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), no compelling new physics signal has been seen yet. Several searches
have been performed at the LHC to look for new physics signal. One such novel
signal is the same-sign diboson (SSdB) + ${E\!\!/}_{T}$ which is a rather clean
signal with negligibly small SM background. Such a unique signature can be
observed in more than one well-motivated BSM scenarios, namely: (i) natural
SUSY models, (ii) type-III seesaw model and (iii) type-II
seesaw/Georgi-Machacek model. In the first part of this poster I present the
discovery prospects of this signal that has been analyzed in these BSM models
in current and future runs of the LHC beside providing ways to distinguish
among these different BSM models. Furthermore, the LHC, being a ""top quark
factory"", helps in precise measurement of various properties of the top quark.
Deviation from the SM prediction in measuring these properties of the top quark
can, very efficiently, shed light on new physics signal. In the second part of
this poster I present a work in progress where we aim to show how precise
measurement of quantities related to top quark features can indicate towards a

observe the displaced vertices of the long-lived dark $Z$ boson at the CERN LHC

the SHiP experiment will probe $2 m_e < m_{Z'} < 15~{\rm MeV}$ range with $6

polarization of the produced hadrons on symmetric colliders -- such as the
Large Hadron Collider when conducting the $pp$ collisions -- are revealed. It
can be proved that the transverse polarization of the produced particles with
opposite pseudorapidity takes exactly opposite values if the normal vector of
the production plane is defined in a convention-dependent way, regardless of
whether parity is conserved or not in the production process. The analysis
shows that, due to the symmetry of the initial state, the $\Lambda_b$
transverse polarization measured by the CMS collaboration in Phys. Rev. D 97,
072010 (2018) should be exactly equal to zero. A modified measurement of the

and a vector-like $SU(2)$ triplet lepton (VLL), both of which are $Z_2$-odd.
The vector current of the VLL with the $Z$-boson rules out a fermionic or
two-component dark matter scenario. However, a compressed mass spectrum and a
sufficiently small Yukawa coupling allows co-annihilation and late decay of the
VLL into the IDM sector, affecting the relic density of the pseudoscalar dark
matter. The same two factors enable displaced decay of the VLL states,
providing novel signatures involving hadronically quiet displaced multi-lepton
final states. Such signatures to probe the model are studied at the 14 and 27

"95 gev diphoton and $b \bar{b}$ excesses in the general next-to-minimal
  supersymmetric standard model","The CMS and ATLAS collaborations recently published their results searching
for light Higgs bosons, using the complete Run 2 data of the LHC. Both reported
an excess in the diphoton invariant mass distribution at $m_{\gamma \gamma}
\simeq 95.4~{\rm GeV}$ with compatible signal strengths. The combined result
corresponded to a local significance of $3.1\sigma$. Besides, the mass of the
diphoton signal coincided with that of the $b\bar{b}$ excess observed at the
LEP. Given the remarkable theoretical advantages of the general Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model, we interpret these excesses by the resonant
productions of the singlet-dominated CP-even Higgs boson predicted by the
theory. Using both analytic formulae and numerical results, we show that the
idea can interpret the excesses by broad parameter space without contradicting
current experimental restrictions, including those from the 125~{\rm GeV} Higgs
data, the dark matter relic abundance and direct detection experiments, and the
collider searches for supersymmetry and extra Higgs bosons. Although the
explanations are scarcely affected by present Higgs data and the LHC search for

"significance of the negative binomial distribution in multiplicity
  phenomena","The negative binomial distribution (NBD) has been theorized to express a
scale-invariant property of many-body systems and has been consistently shown
to outperform other statistical models in both describing the multiplicity of
quantum-scale events in particle collision experiments and predicting the
prevalence of cosmological observables, such as the number of galaxies in a
region of space. Despite its widespread applicability and empirical success in
these contexts, a theoretical justification for the NBD from first principles
has remained elusive for fifty years. The accuracy of the NBD in modeling
hadronic, leptonic, and semileptonic processes is suggestive of a highly
general principle, which is yet to be understood. This study demonstrates that
a statistical event of the NBD can in fact be derived in a general context via
the dynamical equations of a canonical ensemble of particles in Minkowski
space. These results describe a fundamental feature of many-body systems that
is consistent with data from the ALICE and ATLAS experiments and provides an
explanation for the emergence of the NBD in these multiplicity observations.

"first shot of the smoking gun: probing the electroweak phase transition
  in the 2hdm with novel searches for $a \to zh$ in $\ell^+ \ell^- t \bar{t}$
  and $ŒΩŒΩb \bar{b}$ final states","Recently the ATLAS collaboration has reported the first results of searches
for heavy scalar resonances decaying into a $Z$ boson and a lighter new scalar
resonance, where the $Z$ boson decays leptonically and the lighter scalar
decays into a top-quark pair, giving rise to $\ell^+ \ell^- t \bar{t}$ final
states. This had previously been identified as a smoking-gun signature at the
LHC for a first-order electroweak phase transition (FOEWPT) within the
framework of two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs). In addition, ATLAS also
presented new limits where the $Z$ boson decays into pairs of neutrinos and the
lighter scalar resonance into bottom-quark pairs, giving rise to the $\nu \nu b
\bar b$ final state. We analyze the impact of these new searches on the 2HDM
parameter space, with emphasis on their capability to probe currently allowed
2HDM regions featuring a strong FOEWPT. We also study the complementarity of
these new searches with other LHC probes that could target the FOEWPT region of
the 2HDM. Remarkably, the ATLAS search in the $\ell^+ \ell^- t \bar{t}$ final
state shows a local $2.85\,\sigma$ excess (for masses of about 650 GeV and 450
GeV for the heavy and light resonance) in the 2HDM parameter region that would
yield a FOEWPT in the early universe, which could constitute the first
experimental hint of baryogenesis at the electroweak scale. We analyze the
implications of this excess, and discuss the detectability prospects for the
associated gravitational wave signal from the FOEWPT. Furthermore, we project
the sensitivity reach of the $\ell^+ \ell^- t \bar{t}$ signature for the
upcoming runs of the LHC. Finally, we introduce the python package thdmTools, a

nearly independent of the dark neutrino masses, while the $5\sigma$ discovery

"analysis of final state lepton polarization-dependent observables in
  $h\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-} Œ≥$ in the sm at loop level","Recently, the CMS and ATLAS collaborations have announced the results for
$H\rightarrow Z[\rightarrow \ell^{+}\ell^{-}]\gamma$ with $\ell=e$ or $\mu$
\cite{CMS:2022ahq,CMS:2023mku}, where $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ is a sub-process
of $H\rightarrow \ell^{+} \ell^{-} \gamma$. This semi-leptonic Higgs decay
receives loop induced resonant $H\rightarrow Z[\rightarrow
\ell^{+}\ell^{-}]\gamma$ as well as non-resonant contributions. % as discussed
in \cite{Kachanovich:2021pvx}.
  To probe further features coming from these contributions to $H\rightarrow
\ell^{+} \ell^{-} \gamma$, we argue that the polarization of the final state
leptons is also an important parameter. We show that the contribution from the
interference of resonant and non-resonant terms plays an important role when
the polarization of final state lepton is taken into account, which is
negligible in the case of unpolarized leptons. For this purpose, we have
calculated the polarized decay rates and the longitudinal ($P_L$), normal
($P_N$) and transverse ($P_T$) polarization asymmetries. We find that these
asymmetries purely come from the loop contributions and are helpful to further
investigate the resonant and non-resonant nature of $H\rightarrow Z[\rightarrow
\ell^{+}\ell^{-}]\gamma$ decay. We observe that for $\ell=e,\mu$, the
longitudinal decay rate is highly suppressed around $m_{\ell\ell}\approx 60$GeV
when the final lepton spin is $-\frac{1}{2}$, dramatically increasing the
corresponding lepton polarization asymmetries. Furthermore, we analyze another
observable, the ratio of decay rates $R^{\ell\ell'}_{i\pm}$, where $\ell$ and
$\ell'$ refer to different final state lepton generations. Precise measurements
of these observables at the HL-LHC and the planned $e^{+}e^{-}$ can provide a

taking aim at the wino-higgsino plane with the lhc,"In this work we explore multiple search strategies for higgsinos and mixed
higgsino-wino states in the MSSM and project the results onto the $(\mu,M_2)$
plane. Assuming associated production of higgsino-like pairs with a $W/Z$
boson, we develop a search in a channel characterized by a hadronically tagged
vector boson accompanied by missing energy. We use as our template an ATLAS
search for dark matter produced in association with a hadronically decaying
vector boson, but upgrade the search by implementing a joint likelihood
analysis, binning the missing transverse energy distribution, which greatly
improves the search sensitivity. For higgsino-like states (more than 96%
admixture) we find sensitivity to masses up to 550 GeV. For well-mixed
higgsino-wino states (70-30% higgsino) we still find sensitivities above 300

disappearing tracks, soft leptons, trileptons, and hadronic diboson events in
order to predict LHC coverage of the $(\mu,M_2)$ mass plane at integrated

searching for sbottom lsp at the lhc,"Assuming that the sbottom is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), we
carry out an analysis of the relevant signals expected at the LHC. The
discussion is established in the framework of the $\mu\nu$SSM, where the
presence of $R$-parity violating couplings involving right-handed neutrinos
solves simultaneously the $\mu$-problem and the accommodation of neutrino
masses and mixing angles. The sbottoms are pair produced at the LHC, decaying
to a lepton and a top quark or a neutrino and a bottom quark. The decays can be
prompt or displaced, depending on the regions of the parameter space of the
model. We focus the analysis on the right sbottom LSP, since the left sbottom
is typically heavier than the left stop because of the D-term contribution. We
compare the predictions of this scenario with ATLAS and CMS searches for prompt
and long-lived particles. To analyze the parameter space we sample the
$\mu\nu$SSM for a right sbottom LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the
current experimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavor
observables. For displaced (prompt) decays, our results translate into lower

  multi-jet and photonic searches at 13 tev lhc","The current status of `fat-brane' minimal Universal Extra Dimensions
(fat-mUED) is studied in the light of ATLAS experiment's recent reports. At the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) color charged first level Kaluza-Klein (KK)
particles (first level excited quarks and gluons) can be abundantly
pair-produced due to conserved quantity, viz., KK-parity, and strong
interaction. The cascade decay of these particles to one or more Standard Model
(SM) particle(s) and lighter first level KK particle(s) stops after producing
the lightest excited massive state, named as the lightest KK particle (LKP).
With the presence of gravity induced decays, stability of the LKP is lost and
it may decay to photon or Z-boson by radiating KK-excited gravitons, hence
leading to final state with photon(s) at the LHC. A variant signal topology is
established when pair-produced first level colored KK particles undergo direct
decay to an associated SM partner along with KK-excitations of graviton; thus
leading to a signal with two hard jets and substantial missing energy. The
ATLAS experiment lately reported two searches at 13 TeV LHC with 139
inverse-femtobarn of data; (i) multi-jet and (ii) photon and jets with missing
energy. In both searches, the results showed no substantial deviation from the
number of background events of the SM. Provided the absence of any number of
excess events in both searches we constrained the parameters of the fat-mUED
model, viz., the higher-dimensional Planck mass and the compactification scale.","{'Esra Akyumuk', 'Durmus Karabacak'}",2023-09-01T17:01:41Z,2023-09-01 17:01:41+00:00
third order qcd predictions for fiducial w-boson production,"Measurements of W-boson production at the LHC have reached percent-level
precision and impose challenging demands on theoretical predictions. Such
predictions directly limit the precision of measurements of fundamental
quantities such as the W-boson mass and the weak mixing angle. A dominant
source of uncertainty in predictions is from higher-order QCD effects. We
present a calculation of W-boson production at the level of $\alpha_s^3$ at
fixed order and including transverse-momentum resummation. We further show
predictions for a direct comparison with low-pileup ATLAS transverse-momentum
and fiducial cross-section measurements at $\sqrt{s}=5.02\text{ TeV}$. We
discuss in detail the impact of modern PDFs. Our calculation including the
matching to W+jet production at NNLO will be publicly available the upcoming

"h(650) -> w+w-/zz predicts h++ -> w+w+ and h+ -> zw+, as indicated by
  lhc data","Several indications for neutral scalars are observed at the LHC. One of them,
a broad resonance peaked at about 650 GeV which we call H(650), was first
observed by an outsider combining published histograms from ATLAS and CMS on ZZ
-> 4 leptons searches, and this combination shows a local significance close to
4 s.d. Since then, CMS has reported two other indications at the same mass,
with similar local significances: H->WW->2leptons+neutrinos and
H(650)->bbh(125) where mbb~90 GeV and h(125)->gam gam. ATLAS has completed its
analysis of ZZ->4 leptons from which we infer an indication for H(650) with 3.5
s.d. significance. Combining these three results, one gets a global statistical
significance above 6 s.d. H(650) has a coupling to WW similar to h(125) and
therefore we argue that a sum rule (SR) required by unitarity for W+W-
scattering implies that there should be a compensating effect from a doubly
charged scalar H++, with a large coupling to W+W+. We therefore predict that
this mode should become visible through the vector boson fusion process
W+W+->H++, naturally provided by LHC. A recent indication for H++(450)->W+W+
from ATLAS allows a model independent interpretation of this result through the
SR constraint which gives BR(H++->W+W+)~10%, implying the occurrence of
additional decay modes H+W+ and H+H+ from one or several light H+ with masses
below mH++ - mW or MH++/2, that is mH+ < 370 GeV or 225 GeV. A similar analysis
is performed for H+(375)->ZW, indicated by ATLAS and CMS. Both channels suggest
a scalar field content similar to the Georgi Machacek model with triplets, at
variance with the models usually considered. Implications on precision
measurements are presented followed by a complete extraction of the GM
parameters. An alternate interpretation of the 650 GeV resonance as a tensor is
also briefly discussed. Implications for precision measurements are presented.","{'Alain Le Yaouanc', 'Fran√ßois Richard'}",2024-03-05T15:56:10Z,2023-08-23 15:02:28+00:00
nnlo+ps $w^+w^-$ production using jet veto resummation at nnll$'$,"We construct a novel event generator for the process $p \> p \to \ell^- \>
\bar{\nu}_\ell \> \ell'^+ \> \nu_{\ell'}$, which matches fixed-order
predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling to a parton
shower program. The matching is achieved using the GENEVA method, in this case
exploiting a resummed calculation for the hardest jet transverse momentum at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy obtained via soft-collinear
effective theory and implemented in the C++ library SCETlib. This choice of
resolution variable ensures that the introduction of a jet veto, commonly used
by experimental analyses to reject multi-jet background events, does not result
in the appearance of unmitigated large logarithms for low veto scales before
showering. After validating our partonic results against publicly available
fixed order and resummed calculations, we compare our predictions to
measurements taken at the ATLAS and CMS experiments, finding good agreement.
This is the first NNLO+PS accurate event generator to use the hardest jet
transverse momentum as a resolution variable.","{'Alessandro Gavardi', 'Simone Alioli', 'Matthew A. Lim', 'Frank Tackmann'}",2023-08-22T17:27:53Z,2023-08-22 17:27:53+00:00
"uncovering new higgses in the lhc analyses of differential $t\bar t$
  cross sections","Statistically significant tensions between the Standard Model (SM)
predictions and the measured lepton distributions in differential top
cross-sections emerged in LHC Run~1 data and became even more pronounced in
Run~2 analyses. Due to the level of sophistication of the SM predictions and
the performance of the ATLAS and CMS detectors, this is very remarkable.
Therefore, one should seriously consider the possibility that these
measurements are contaminated by beyond-the-SM contributions. In this article,
we use differential lepton distributions from the latest ATLAS $t\bar t$
analysis to study a new physics benchmark model motivated by existing
indications for new Higgses: a new scalar $H$ is produced via gluon fusion and
decays to $S^\prime$ ($95\,$GeV) and $S$ ($152\,$GeV), which subsequently decay
to $b\bar b$ and $WW$, respectively. In this setup, the total $\chi^2$ is
reduced, compared to the SM, resulting in $\Delta\chi^2=34$ to
$\Delta\chi^2=158$, depending on the SM simulation used. Notably, allowing
$m_S$ to vary, the combination of the distributions points towards
$m_S\!\approx\!150\,$GeV which is consistent with the existing $\gamma \gamma$
and $WW$ signals, rendering a mismodelling of the SM unlikely. Averaging the
results of the different SM predictions, a non-vanishing cross-section for
$pp\to H\to SS^\prime\to b\bar b WW$ of $\approx\!13$pb is preferred. If
$S^\prime$ is SM-like, this cross-section, at the same time explains the
$95\,$GeV $\gamma\gamma$ excess, while the dominance of $S\to WW$ suggests that
$S$ is the neutral component of the $SU(2)_L$ triplet with hypercharge~0.","{'Sumit Banik', 'Bruce Mellado', 'Andreas Crivellin', 'Guglielmo Coloretti'}",2023-08-15T18:00:01Z,2023-08-15 18:00:01+00:00

the decays $Z\to H_1 \gamma, A_1 \gamma$ can serve as an excellent
complementary test to $BR(h_{\rm SM}\to Z\gamma)$. In fact, to facilitate
future searches, we unveil a few benchmark points that additionally satisfy the
deviation of $BR(h_{\rm SM}\to Z\gamma)$ from the SM value based on the recent
measurements of ATLAS and CMS. Future proposals such as ILC, CEPC, and FCC-ee
are anticipated to operate for multiple years, focusing on center-of-mass

conducting experiments at the Giga-$Z$ ($10^{9}$ of $Z$ bosons) and Tera-$Z$

w boson mass in the np models with extra $u(1)$ gauge group,"The precise measurement of the W boson mass is closely related to the
contributions of new physics (NP), which can significantly constrain the
parameter space of NP models, particularly those with an additional $U(1)$
local gauge group. The inclusion of a new $Z'$ gauge boson and gauge couplings
in these models can contribute to the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, $U$ and W
boson mass at tree level. Taking into account the effects of kinetic mixing, we
calculate and analyze the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, $U$ and W boson mass in
such NP models in this study. It is found that the kinetic mixing effects can
make significant contributions to the W boson mass, which can satisfy the
recently measured W boson mass at CDF II or ATLAS by choosing appropriate
values of gauge coupling constants and extra $U(1)$ group charges of leptons or
scalar doublets. In addition, if the leptonic Yukawa couplings are invariant
under the extra $U(1)$ local gauge group, these contributions can be eliminated
by redefining the gauge boson fields through eliminating the neutral currents
involving charged leptons, even with nonzero kinetic mixing effects.","{'Sheng-Kai Cui', 'Tai-Fu Feng', 'Jin-Lei Yang', 'Zhao-Feng Ge', 'Xiu-Yi Yang'}",2023-08-16T08:45:29Z,2023-08-10 02:48:49+00:00

excitations ($\gamma \gamma \to R$) and deexcitation ($R \to \gamma \gamma$).
The broad range of (pseudo)rapidities and lower cuts on transverse momenta open
a necessity to consider not only dominant box contributions but also other
subleading contributions. Here we include low mass resonant $R = \pi^0$,
$\eta$, $\eta'$ contributions. The resonance contributions give intermediate
photon transverse momenta. However, these contributions can be eliminated by
imposing windows on di-photon invariant mass. We study and quantify individual
box contributions (leptonic, quarkish). The electron/positron boxes dominate at
low $M_{\gamma \gamma}<1$ GeV di-photon invariant masses. The

distributions are presented and discussed. We consider four different kinematic

the flavor of a light charged higgs,"The ATLAS Collaboration has recently reported a search for light-charged

signal in multi-Higgs doublet models. We take into account constraints from
searches for other charged Higgs decays and from flavor-changing neutral
current processes. Two Higgs doublet models with flavor structure dictated by
natural flavor conservation (NFC), minimal flavor violation (MFV), or the
Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism cannot account for such excess. A three-Higgs
doublet model with NFC can account for the signal. The Yukawa couplings of the
neutral pseudoscalar $A$ in the down sector, $\hat Y_A^D$, should be larger by
a factor of $4-6$ compared to the corresponding Yukawa couplings of the Higgs
$h$, $\hat Y_h^D$. We further present two minimal scenarios, one in which a
single Yukawa coupling in the down sector, $(\hat Y_A^D)_{bb}$, gives the only
significant contribution, and one in which two Yukawa couplings in the up

The electromagnetic decays become dominant in cases where the strong decays are
suppressed. The experimental uncertainties are propagated to the model
parameters using a Monte Carlo bootstrap method. Our quantum number

reasonable agreement with the available data. We also provide the partial decay
widths for each open flavor channel. Our predictions of mass spectra and decay

$\approx152\,$GeV ($S$). The presence of a $95\,$GeV scalar is preferred over
the Standard Model hypothesis by $3.8\sigma$, while interpreting the $152\,$GeV
excesses in a simplified model with resonant pair production of $S$ via a new
heavier scalar $H(270)$, a global significance of $\approx5\sigma$ is obtained.
While the production mechanism of the $S^\prime$ cannot yet be determined, data
strongly favours the associated production of $S$, i.e. via the decay of a
heavier boson $H$ ($pp\to H\to SS^*$). A possible alternative or complementary
decay chain is $H\rightarrow SS^{\prime}$, where $S\to WW^*$ ($S^{\prime}$)
would be the source of the leptons ($b$-quarks) necessary to explain the
multi-lepton anomalies found in Large Hadron Collider data.","{'Mukesh Kumar', 'Andreas Crivellin', 'Yaquan Fang', 'Guglielmo Coloretti', 'Bruce Mellado', 'Srimoy Bhattacharya', 'Salah-Eddine Dahbi'}",2023-06-29T18:00:00Z,2023-06-29 18:00:00+00:00
"precise predictions for the associated production of a $w$ boson with a

Hadron Collider (LHC). Since the first observation reported in 2015 the
corresponding rates have been found to be consistently higher than the Standard
Model predictions, which are based on next-to-leading order~(NLO) calculations
in the QCD and electroweak (EW) interactions. We present the first
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD computation of $t\bar tW$ production
at hadron colliders. The calculation is exact, except for the finite part of
the two-loop virtual corrections, which is estimated using two different
approaches that lead to consistent results within their uncertainties. We
combine the newly computed NNLO QCD corrections with the complete NLO QCD+EW
results, thus obtaining the most advanced perturbative prediction available to

include all possible decay modes of vector-like leptons. Therefore, the
analyses done so far are incomplete. In this letter, we highlight decay
channels that are not covered by different experimental analyses, with a focus

constraining the top-quark mass within the global msht pdf fit,"We examine the ability of experimental measurements of top-quark pair
production to constrain both the top-quark mass and the strong coupling within
the global MSHT parton distribution function (PDF) fit. Specifically, we
consider ATLAS and CMS measurements of differential distributions taken at a
centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, as well as $t\bar{t}$ total cross section data
taken at a variety of experiments, and compare to theoretical predictions
including next-to-next-to-leading order corrections. We find that supplementing
the global fit with this additional information results in relatively strong
constraints on the top-quark mass, and is also able to bound the strong
coupling in a limited fashion. Our final result is
$m_t=173.0\pm0.6~\mathrm{GeV}$ and is compatible with the world average pole
mass extracted from cross section measurements of $172.5\pm0.7~\mathrm{GeV}$ by
the Particle Data Group. We also study the effect of different top-quark masses
on the gluon parton distribution function, finding changes at high $x$ which

"indirect search for lepton flavour violating signals at the future
  electron-proton colliders","The search for lepton flavor violation (LFV) is a powerful probe to look for
new physics beyond the Standard Model. We explored the possibility of searches
for LFV $Z$ boson couplings to electron and muon pair at the upcoming
electron-proton colliders, namely the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) and
the Future Circular lepton-hadron Collider (FCC-eh). We employed the study via
a single muon plus an associated jet channel to search for the LFV signal. We
used a multivariate technique to obtain an improved signal-background analysis.
By using the condition on nonobservation of any significant deviation of the
signal over the expected background, we provide an upper limit on the LFV $Z$
boson coupling and corresponding branching ratio. We find that an upper limit
of $2.0\times 10^{-7}$ and $1.5 \times 10^{-7}$ the can be set on BR($Z\to e

"explanation of the hints for a 95 gev higgs boson within a 2-higgs
  doublet model","We suggest an explanation for and explore the consequences of the excess
around 95 GeV in the di-photon and di-tau invariant mass distributions recently
reported by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), together
with the discrepancy that has long been observed at the Large Electron-Positron
(LEP) collider in the $b\bar b$ invariant mass. Interestingly, the most recent
findings announced by the ATLAS collaboration do not contradict, or even
support, these intriguing observations. Their search in the di-photon final
state similarly reveals an excess of events within the same mass range, albeit
with a bit lower significance, thereby corroborating and somewhat reinforcing
the observations made by CMS. We have found that all three signatures can be
explained within the general 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-III. We
demonstrate that the lightest CP-even Higgs boson in this scenario can explain
the excess in all three channels simultaneously, i.e., in the di-photon, di-tau
and $b\bar b$ mass spectra, while satisfying up-to-date theoretical and
experimental constraints. Moreover, the 2HDM Type-III predicts an excess in the
$pp\to t\bar t H_{\rm SM}$ production channel of the 125 GeV Higgs boson
discovered in 2012, with properties (couplings, spin and CP quantum numbers)
consistent with those predicted in the Standard Model (SM). This effect is
caused by a up to 18\% enhancement of the Yukawa coupling to top (anti)quarks
in comparison to the SM value. Such an effect can be tested soon at the High
Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which can either discover or exclude the scenario we
suggest. This unique characteristic of the 2HDM Type-III makes this scenario
with the 95 GeV resonance very attractive for further theoretical and
experimental investigations at the (HL-)LHC and future colliders.","{'Manimala Chakraborti', 'Stefano Moretti', 'Mohammed Boukidi', 'Rachid Benbrik', 'Alexander Belyaev', 'Souad Semlali'}",2023-06-15T10:40:57Z,2023-06-15 10:40:57+00:00
quantum entanglement in top quark pair production,"Top quarks, the most massive particles in the standard model, attract
considerable attention since they decay before hadronizing. This presents
physicists with a unique opportunity to directly investigate their properties.
In this letter, we expand upon the work of G. Iskander, J. Pan, M. Tyler, C.
Weber and O. K. Baker to demonstrate that even with the most massive
fundamental particle, we see the same manifestation of entanglement observed in
both electroweak and electromagnetic interactions. We propose that the thermal
component resulting from protons colliding into two top quarks emerges from
entanglement within the two-proton wave function. The presence of entanglement
implies the coexistence of both thermal and hard scattering components in the
transverse momentum distribution. We use published ATLAS and CMS results to
show that the data exhibits the expected behavior.","{'O. K. Baker', 'Mira Varma'}",2023-09-29T13:56:43Z,2023-06-13 14:08:47+00:00
"quantifying the interplay of experimental constraints in analyses of
  parton distributions","Parton distribution functions (PDFs) play a central role in calculations for
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To gain a deeper understanding of the
emergence and interplay of constraints on the PDFs in the global QCD analyses,
it is important to examine the relative significance and mutual compatibility
of the experimental data sets included in the PDF fits. Toward this goal, we
discuss the L2 sensitivity, a convenient statistical indicator for exploring
the statistical pulls of individual data sets on the best-fit PDFs and
identifying tensions between competing data sets. Unlike the Lagrange
Multiplier method, the L2 sensitivity can be quickly computed for a range of
PDFs and momentum fractions using the published Hessian error sets. We employ
the L2 sensitivity as a common metric to study the relative importance of data
sets in the recent ATLAS, CTEQ-TEA, MSHT, and reduced PDF4LHC21 PDF analyses at
NNLO and approximate N3LO. We illustrate how this method can aid the users of
PDFs to identify data sets that are important for a PDF at a given kinematic
point, to study quark flavor composition and other detailed features of the
PDFs, and to compare the data pulls on the PDFs for various perturbative orders
and functional forms. We also address the feasibility of computing the
sensitivities using Monte Carlo error PDFs. Together with the article, we
present a companion interactive website with a large collection of plotted L2
sensitivities for eight recent PDF releases.","{'Keping Xie', 'Francesco Giuli', 'Joey Huston', 'Amanda Cooper-Sarkar', 'Robert S. Thorne', 'Xiaoxian Jing', 'Pavel Nadolsky', 'T. J.

the 95.4 gev di-photon excess at atlas and cms,"The ATLAS collaboration has recently reported the results of a low-mass
Higgs-boson search in the di-photon final state based on the full Run 2 data
set. The results are based on an improved analysis w.r.t. the previous
analysis, which included a part of the Run 2 data, with a substantially better
sensitivity. The ``model-dependent'' search carried out by ATLAS shows an
excess of events at a mass of about 95.4 GeV with a local significance of
$1.7\,\sigma$. The results are compatible with a previously reported excess at
the same mass, but somewhat higher significance of $2.9\,\sigma$, from the CMS
collaboration, also based on the full Run 2 data set. Combining the two results
(neglecting possible correlations) we find a signal strength of
$\mu_{\gamma\gamma}^{\rm ATLAS+CMS} = 0.24^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, corresponding to
an excess of $3.1\,\sigma$. In this work, we investigate the implications of
this result, updating a previous analysis based solely on the CMS Run 2 data.
We demonstrate that the ATLAS/CMS combined di-photon excess can be interpreted
as the lightest Higgs boson in a Two-Higgs doublet model that is extended by a
complex singlet (S2HDM) of Yukawa types II and IV, while being in agreement
with all other experimental and theoretical constraints.","{'T. Biek√∂tter', 'S. Heinemeyer', 'G. Weiglein'}",2024-03-12T13:41:46Z,2023-06-06 17:47:28+00:00

the diphoton channel at about this diphoton invariant mass with local
statistical significances of $2.9 \, \sigma$ and $1.7 \,\sigma$, respectively.
Furthermore, a $2 \, \sigma$ excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state was also
observed at LEP, again pointing at a similar mass value. We interpret these
intriguing hints of new physics in a variant of the Scotogenic model, an
economical scenario that induces Majorana neutrino masses at the loop level and
includes a viable dark matter candidate. We show that our model can naturally
explain the 95 GeV excesses while respecting all experimental constraints and

2hdm interpretations of the cms diphoton excess at 95 gev,"In both Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC, the CMS collaboration has observed an
excess of events in the searches for low-mass Higgs bosons in the diphoton
final state at a mass of about 95 GeV. After a recent update of the
experimental analysis, in which the full Run 2 data collected at 13 TeV has
been included and an improved experimental calibration has been applied, the
local significance of the excess amounts to $2.9\sigma$. The presence of this
diphoton excess is especially interesting in view of a further excess observed
by CMS in ditau final states at a comparable mass and similar local
significance. Moreover, an excess of events with about $2\sigma$ local
significance and consistent with a mass of 95 GeV was observed in LEP searches
for a Higgs boson decaying to pairs of bottom quarks. We interpret the CMS
diphoton excess in combination with the ditau excess in terms of a pseudoscalar
resonance in the CP-conserving two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). Furthermore, we
discuss the possibility that, if CP-violation is taken into account, a CP-mixed
scalar state can in addition describe the LEP result, thus accommodating all
three excesses simultaneously. We find that the region of parameter space where
both the CMS diphoton and ditau excesses can be fitted is in tension with
current constraints from the flavour sector, potentially calling for other
new-physics contributions to flavour-physics observables, most notably $b \to
s\gamma$ transitions. We also comment on the compatibility with the recent
ATLAS di-photon searches.","{'Duarte Azevedo', 'Thomas Biek√∂tter', 'P. M. Ferreira'}",2023-06-28T12:00:22Z,2023-05-31 10:10:47+00:00
"investigation of higgs boson decaying to di-muon, dark matter produced
  in association with a higgs boson decaying to $b$-quarks and unbinned
  profiled unfolding","The discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson by ATLAS and CMS at the
LHC in 2012 marked a major milestone in particle physics. However, many
questions remain unanswered, which has led to an active research program to
search for either rare SM phenomena or Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics that
involve the Higgs boson. In this dissertation, I present two example searches
involving the Higgs boson, using proton-proton ($pp$) collision data collected
by the ATLAS detector. The first search tackles the problem of how the SM Higgs
couples to the second-generation fermions. It searches for the dimuon decay of
the SM Higgs boson using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139
fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\
\mathrm{TeV}$ at the LHC. In the second search, we look for Dark Matter
produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to $b$-quarks. This search
uses the same dataset as the $H\to\mu\mu$ search and targets events that
contain large missing transverse momentum and either two $b$-tagged
small-radius jets or a single large-radius jet associated with two $b$-tagged
subjets. In addition to the two physics analyses, unfolding is a key procedure
in the high energy experiments, which corrects data for the detector effect. I
present a new unfolding method that allows to unfold data without having any
artificial binning and is also able to profile nuisance parameters
simultaneously. This new method provides much higher flexibility and increases
the reusability for different downstream tasks compared to the traditional
approach. It will benifit any future analyses including Higgs physics and Dark
Matter searches.",{'Jay Chan'},2023-05-30T22:08:00Z,2023-05-30 22:08:00+00:00
"the global fits of new physics in $b \to s $ after $r_{k^{(*)}}$ 2022
  release","The measurement of lepton universality parameters $R_{K^{(*)}}$ was updated
by LHCb in December 2022, which indicated that the well-known anomalies in
flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes of B meson decays have faded
away. However, does this mean that all new physics possibilities related to
$b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ have been excluded? We aim to answer this question in this
work. The state-of-the-art effective Hamiltonian is adopted to describe $b \to
s$ transition, while BSM (beyond the Standard Model) new physics effects are
encoded in Wilson coefficients (WCs). Using around 200 observables in leptonic
and semileptonic decays of B mesons and bottom baryons, measured by LHCb, CMS,
ATLAS, Belle, and BaBar, we perform global fits of these Wilson coefficients in
four different scenarios. In particular, lepton flavors in WCs are specified in
some of the working scenarios. To see the change of new physics parameters, we
use both the data before and after the 2022 release of $R_{K^{(*)}}$ in two
separate sets of fits. We find that in three of the four scenarios, $\Delta
C_9^\mu$ still has a deviation around or more than $4\sigma$ from the Standard
Model. The lepton flavor in WCs is distinguishable for $\Delta C_{9}$ at the
$1\sigma$ level, but at the $2\sigma$ level all the operators are flavor
identical. We demonstrate numerically that there is no chirality for muon type
of scalar operator and it is kept at the $1\sigma$ level for their electron
type dual ones, while chiral difference exists for $\mathcal{O}_{9}^\mu$ at
least at the $2\sigma$ level. Moreover, it can be deduced that the scalar
operators $\mathcal{O}_{S,P}^{(')\mu}$ become null if new physics emerges in
terms of SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) up to dimension-6.","{'Qiaoyi Wen', 'Fanrong Xu'}",2023-10-29T07:01:25Z,2023-05-30 13:56:26+00:00

a novel beam-dump measurement with the lhc general-purpose detectors,"We propose a novel scheme for performing a beam-dump-like experiment with the
general-purpose detectors (ATLAS and CMS) at the LHC. Collisions of high-energy
protons result in jets containing a number of energetic hadrons and
electromagnetic objects that are essentially ""dumped"" to hadronic and
electromagnetic calorimeters, respectively, and induce the production of
secondary hadrons, electrons, and photons in calorimetric showers. We envision
a situation where new physics particles are produced by the interactions of
these secondary particles inside the calorimeters. For proof of principles, we
consider the axion-like particles (ALPs) produced via the Primakoff process in
the presence of their interaction with photons at CMS. We argue that the drift
tube chambers and the ME0 module of the muon system can serve as detectors to
record the photons from the ALP decay, demonstrating that the resulting
sensitivity reach is competitive due to their close proximity to the signal
source points. We further show that the LHC does not suffer from a barrier,
dubbed beam-dump ""ceiling"", that typical beam-dump experiments hardly surpass,
carrying the great potential for exploring a wide range of parameter space in
increasing statistics. This analysis can be extended to investigate various
types of light mediators with couplings to the Standard Model leptons and

agree well but the fiducial distributions can differ at a percent level. We

"forward-backward multiplicity and momentum correlations in pp and ppb

ultra-relativistic nuclear collision remain one of the successor to understand
the basics of the particle production mechanism. More differential tools like
Forward-Backward (FB) correlations between particles from two different
phase-space further strengthened our cognizance. We have studied the strength
of FB correlations in terms of charged particle multiplicity and summed
transverse momentum for proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-lead ($pPb$) collisions
at the centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ =
5.02 TeV respectively for the EPOS3 simulated events with hydrodynamical
evolution of produced particles. Furthermore, the correlation strengths are
separately obtained for the particles coming from the core and the corona. FB
correlation strengths are examined as a function of psedorapidity gap
($\eta_{gap}$), psedorapidity window-width ($\delta\eta$), centre-of-mass
energy ($\sqrt{s}$), minimum transverse momentum ($p_{Tmin}$) and different
multiplicity classes following standard kinematical cuts used by the ALICE and
the ATLAS experiments at the LHC for all three EPOS3 event samples. EPOS3 model
shows a similar trend of FB multiplicity and momentum correlation strengths for
both $pp$ \& $pPb$ systems, though the correlation strengths are found to be
larger for $pPb$ system than $pp$ system. Moreover, $\delta\eta$-weighted
average of FB correlation strengths as a function of different center-of-mass

rule method. The masses $m$, $\widetilde{m}$ and current couplings $f$, $
\widetilde{f}$ of these states are calculated using the two-point sum rule
approach. The obtained results $m=(6264 \pm 50)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $
\widetilde{m}=(6954 \pm 50)~\mathrm{MeV}$ are employed to determine their decay
channels. It is demonstrated that the processes $\mathcal{M}_1\to J/\psi J/\psi
$ and $\mathcal{M}_1\to \eta _{c}\eta _{c}$ are kinematically allowed decay
modes of $\mathcal{M}_1$. The molecule $\mathcal{M}_2$ decays to $J/\psi

a real candidate to the resonance $X(6200)$. The structure $ \mathcal{M}_2$ may
be interpreted as $X(6900)$ or one of its components in combination with a

hunting muonic forces at emulsion detectors,"Only two types of Standard Model particles are able to propagate the
$480\,$meters separating the ATLAS interaction point and FASER: neutrinos and
muons. Furthermore, muons are copiously produced in proton collisions. We
propose to use FASER$\nu$ as a muon fixed target experiment in order to search
for new bosonic degrees of freedom coupled predominantly to muons. These muon
force carriers are particularly interesting in light of the recent measurement
of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Using a novel analysis technique, we
show that even in the current LHC run, FASER$\nu$ could potentially probe
previously unexplored parts of the parameter space. In the high-luminosity
phase of the LHC, we find that the improved sensitivity of FASER$\nu2$ will
probe unexplored parameter space and may be competitive with dedicated search
proposals.","{'Iftah Galon', 'Akitaka Ariga', 'Enrique Kajomovitz', 'Reuven Balkin', 'Yotam Soreq'}",2023-05-04T18:35:33Z,2023-05-04 18:35:33+00:00
"simple, but not simplified: a new approach for optimising
  beyond-standard model physics searches at the large hadron collider","Searches for beyond-Standard Model physics scenarios, such as supersymmetry
(SUSY), at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are frequently optimised on
simplified models. After assuming particular particle production and decay
processes, analyses are optimised by tuning event selections on benchmark
models generated in 2D planes of parameters, with all other parameters held
fixed. Motivated by recent evidence that this removes sensitivity to a large
volume of viable SUSY models, we propose an alternative approach based on
dimensional reduction of global fit results. Starting from the results of a
global fit of the 4D electroweak minimal supersymmetric standard model
performed by the GAMBIT collaboration, we show how to define a 2D plane by
using a variational autoencoder to map points in the original 4D parameter
space to a 2D latent space. This allows for easy visualisation of the 4D global
fit results, which generates insights into what we may be missing at the LHC.
Furthermore, the invertible nature of the map to the 2D plane allows
experimentalists to choose and simulate benchmark models in a 2D plane (as they
could for a simplified model) whilst still accessing the full range of
phenomenological scenarios identified by the global fit in the 4D model. We
provide a demonstration of how our visualisation and benchmark model simulation
process works, and develop an analysis that is able to exclude four benchmark
models not excluded by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in the set of results
used for the global fit.","{'Martin White', 'Anders Kvellestad', 'Melissa van Beekveld', 'Philip Grace', 'Adam Leinweber'}",2023-05-03T00:28:17Z,2023-05-03 00:28:17+00:00
a new higgs boson with electron-muon flavor-violating couplings,"Recently, the CMS Collaboration performed a search on a new resonance
decaying to $e^\pm\mu^\mp$ in the mass range of 110 GeV to 160 GeV. The search
also hints a possible excess at 146 GeV with a $3.8\sigma~(2.8\sigma)$ of local
(global) significance. Motivated by that, we try to interpret the results in
the context of the type-III two-Higgs-doublet-model. We find that the excess is
only moderately constrained by low-energy lepton-flavor-violation processes, in
particular the $\mu\to e \gamma$ decay. We also compare the CMS bounds across
the entire search region against constraints of $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to e$
conversion in nuclei. Our finding indicates that the collider bounds can be
superior to those of low-energy processes for the scalar mass between $110

range for future searches.","{'J. Julio', 'N. Srimanobhas', 'P. Uttayarat', 'R. Primulando'}",2023-08-29T15:06:32Z,2023-04-26 18:00:29+00:00
fully charmed resonance $x(6900)$ and its beauty counterpart,"The fully heavy scalar tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{4Q}}=QQ\overline{Q}\overline{Q

T_{\mathrm{4Q}}$ as diquark-antidiquark systems composed of pseudoscalar
constituents, and calculate their masses $m^{(\prime)}$ and couplings $
f^{(\prime)}$ within the two-point sum rule approach. Our results $m=(6928 \pm

the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{4c}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{4b}}$ prove that they can
decay to hidden-flavor heavy mesons. The full width $\Gamma_{ \mathrm{4c}}$ of
the $T_{\mathrm{4c}}$ is evaluated by taking into account the decay channels
$T_{\mathrm{4c}} \to J/\psi J/\psi $, $J/\psi \psi^{\prime}$, $\eta _{c}\eta

$T_{\mathrm{4c}}J/\psi \psi^{\prime} $ etc., which are computed using the QCD
three-point sum rule method. The decay $T_{\mathrm{4b} } \to \eta_{b}\eta_{b}$
is used to find the width $\Gamma_{\mathrm{4b}}$ of the $T_{\mathrm{4b}}$. The
predictions for $m$ and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{4c} }=(128 \pm 22)~\mathrm{MeV}$ are
compared with parameters of the fully charmed resonances reported by the LHCb,

vectorlike leptons and long-lived bosons at the lhc,"We study a renormalizable theory that includes a heavy weak-singlet
vectorlike lepton, $\tau^\prime$, that decays into a pseudoscalar boson and a
tau lepton. We show that this can be the dominant decay mode of $\tau^\prime$
provided the pseudoscalar couplings deviate from the case of a Nambu-Goldstone
boson. For a range of parameters, the pseudoscalar is long-lived, and mainly
decays into a photon pair at one loop, or into a tau pair at tree level.
Electroweak production of $\tau^{\prime +} \tau^{\prime -}$ leads to a rich
phenomenology at colliders, including signals with many taus or photons. We
analyze in detail the LHC signal involving two prompt taus and two displaced
photon pairs. Particularly interesting is the case where the pseudoscalar has a

"constraint for a light charged higgs boson and its neutral partners from
  top quark pairs at the lhc","The charged Higgs boson plays an essential role in distinguishing between a
wide variety of standard model extensions with multiple Higgs doublets, and has
been searched for in various collider experiments. This paper expands our
previous work to a broader Higgs mass space with discussions on subsequent
issues. We study the prospect of a light charged Higgs boson, produced by top
quark pairs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and decaying into a $W$ boson
(can be off shell) and a pair of bottom quarks via on-shell production of an
intermediate neutral Higgs boson. We reinterpret the cross sections of
$WWbb\bar{b}\bar{b}$ final states measured by the ATLAS collaboration at LHC 13
TeV in the presence of the decay chain: $t \rightarrow H^+ b, H^+ \rightarrow
W^+ H_i, H_i \rightarrow b \bar{b}$, and H.c., where $H_i$ is a neutral Higgs
boson variably lighter than the charged Higgs boson. We find improved
agreements with the data and obtain limits on the total branching ratio of the
aforementioned decay chain. The limits impose the strongest constraints on the
parameter space of type-I two-Higgs-doublet model for most Higgs masses sampled
when $H_i$ is the $CP$-odd Higgs boson $A$. We also calculate potential

parton-shower-matched and multi-jet-merged predictions generated for the ATLAS

study is the use of exact five-point two-loop virtual amplitudes. This is the
first calculation of a complete two-to-three hadron-collider process at
next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD that does not rely on the leading-colour

produced by decays of long-lived particles (LLPs). The exceptional shielding
provided by the steel between the stations of the muon system drastically
reduces the Standard Model background that limits other existing ATLAS and CMS
searches. At the same time, by using the muon system as a sampling calorimeter,
the search is sensitive to LLPs energies rather than masses. We show that,
thanks to these characteristics, this new search approach is sensitive to LLPs

exploring fully heavy scalar tetraquarks $qq\overline{q}\overline{q}$,"The masses, current couplings and widths of the fully heavy scalar
tetraquarks $X_{\mathrm{4Q}}=QQ\overline{Q}\overline{Q}$, $Q=c, b$ are
calculated by modeling them as four-quark systems composed of axial-vector
diquark and antidiquark. The masses $m^{(\prime)}$ and couplings $
f^{(\prime)}$ of these tetraquarks are computed in the context of the QCD sum
rule method by taking into account a nonperturbative term proportional to the
gluon condensate $\langle \alpha _{s}G^{2}/ \pi \rangle$. Results $ m=(6570 \pm
55)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $m^{\prime}=(18540 \pm 50)~\mathrm{MeV}$ are used to fix
kinematically allowed hidden-flavor decay channels of these states. It turns
out that, the processes $X_{\mathrm{4c}}\rightarrow J/\psi J/\psi $,
$X_{\mathrm{4c}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}\eta _{c}$, and $X_{\mathrm{4c
}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}\chi _{c1}(1P)$ are possible decay modes of $X_{
\mathrm{4c}}$. The partial widths of these channels are evaluated by means of
the couplings $g_{i}, i=1,2,3$ which describe strong interactions of tetraquark
$X_{\mathrm{4c}}$ and mesons at relevant vertices. The couplings $ g_{i}$ are
extracted from the QCD three-point sum rules by extrapolating corresponding
form factors $g_{i}(Q^2) $ to the mass-shell of a final meson. The mass of the
scalar tetraquark $X_{\mathrm{4b}}$ is below the $\eta_b \eta_b$ and
$\Upsilon(1S)\Upsilon(1S)$ thresholds, therefore it does not fall apart to
these bottomonia, but transforms to conventional particles through other
mechanisms. Comparing $m=(6570 \pm 55)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $ \Gamma

with chromomagnetic interaction and enhanced binding energy. Considering
color-spin mixing due to chromomagnetic interaction, our mass computation
indicates that the observed $X(6600)$ is likely to be the $0^{++}$ ground
states of hidden-charm tetraquark $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$ with computed masses
$6572$ MeV, which has a $0^{++}$ color partner around $6469$ MeV. The fully
bottom system of tetraquark $bb\bar{b}\bar{b}$ has masses of 19685 MeV and

"implications of nsi constraints from antares and icecube on a simplified

constraints to the non-standard neutrino interaction (NSI) parameter

that ANTARES and IceCube can provide additional constraints to such a new

low-energy flavor physics. Moreover, these neutrino experiments can exclude a

probing dark matter using free leptons: pkmuon,"We propose a new method to detect sub-GeV dark matter, through their
scatterings from free leptons and the resulting kinematic shifts. Specially,
such an experiment can detect dark matter interacting solely with muons. The
experiment proposed here is to directly probe muon-philic dark matter, in a
model-independent way. Its complementarity with the muon on target proposal, is
similar to, e.g. XENON/PandaX and ATLAS/CMS on dark matter searches. Moreover,
our proposal can work better for relatively heavy dark matter such as in the
sub-GeV region. We start with a small device of a size around 0.1 to 1 meter,
using atmospheric muons to set up a prototype. Within only one year of
operation, the sensitivity on cross section of dark matter scattering with
muons can already reach $\sigma_D\sim 10^{-19 (-20,\,-18)}\rm{cm}^{2}$ for a
dark mater $\rm{M_D}=100\, (10,\,1000)$ MeV. We can then interface the device
with a high intensity muon beam of $10^{12}$/bunch. Within one year, the

thermalization at the femtoscale seen in high-energy pb+pb collisions,"A collision between two atomic nuclei accelerated close to the speed of light
creates a dense system of quarks and gluons. Interactions among them are so
strong that they behave collectively like a droplet of fluid of ten-femtometer
size, which expands into the vacuum and eventually fragments into thousands of
particles. We report direct evidence that this fluid reaches thermalization, at
least to some extent, using recent data from the Large Hadron Collider. The
ATLAS Collaboration has measured the variance of the momentum per particle
across Pb+Pb collision events with the same particle multiplicity. It decreases
steeply over a narrow multiplicity range corresponding to central collisions,
which hints at an emergent phenomenon. We show that the observed pattern is
explained naturally if one assumes that, for a given multiplicity, the momentum
per particle increases as a function of the impact parameter of the collision.
Since a larger impact parameter goes along with a smaller collision volume,
this in turn implies that the momentum per particle increases as a function of
density. This is a generic property of relativistic fluids, thus observed for
the first time in a laboratory experiment.","{'Jiangyong Jia', 'Rupam Samanta', 'Jean-Yves Ollitrault', 'Somadutta Bhatta', 'Matthew Luzum'}",2023-03-27T15:22:18Z,2023-03-27 15:22:18+00:00
"sensitivity of anomalous quartic gauge couplings via tri-photon
  production at fcc-hh","A direct investigation of the self-couplings of gauge bosons, completely
described by the non-Abelian gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, is extremely
valuable in understanding the gauge structure of the SM. Any deviation from the
SM predictions on gauge boson self-coupling is to give a hint at the existence
of a new physics beyond the SM, which is defined with a modification of the
self-interactions using an effective field theory approach. In this paper, we
present a detailed Monte Carlo study searching for anomalous quartic gauge
dimension-8 couplings related to $\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma$ and
$\gamma\gamma\gamma Z$ vertices at the future hadron-hadron collider (FCC-hh)
via tri-photon production at a 100 TeV center of mass energy with an integrated

include detector effects are analyzed with a Toolkit for Multivariate Data
Analysis (TMVA) using a boosted decision tree to help distinguish between
signal and background events to achieve the best sensitivities on anomalous
quartic gauge couplings. Our obtained results reveal that the limits on
anomalous quartic gauge couplings $f_{T8}/\Lambda^{4}$ and $f_{T9}/\Lambda^{4}$
at 95\% C.L. without systematic errors are about three orders of magnitude
stronger compared to the best current experimental limits reported by the ATLAS
collaboration at the LHC. Considering a realistic systematic uncertainty such
as 10\% from possible experimental sources, our obtained limits of anomalous

without systematic uncertainty but are still two orders of magnitude better
than those recently reported by ATLAS.","{'C. Helveci', 'H. Denizli', 'A. Senol'}",2023-04-25T10:09:25Z,2023-03-26 20:11:47+00:00
"exclusive diffractive bremsstrahlung of one and two photons at forward
  rapidities: possibilities for experimental studies in $pp$ collisions at the
  lhc","We evaluate the cross section for diffractive bremsstrahlung of a single
photon in the $pp \to pp \gamma$ reaction at high energies and at forward
photon rapidities. Several differential distributions, for instance, in $y$,
$k_{\perp}$ and $\omega$, the rapidity, the absolute value of the transverse
momentum, and the energy of the photon, respectively, are presented. We compare
the results for our standard approach, based on QFT and the tensor-pomeron
model, with two versions of soft-photon-approximations, SPA1 and SPA2, where
the radiative amplitudes contain only the leading terms proportional to
$\omega^{-1}$. The SPA1, which does not have the correct energy-momentum
relations, performs surprisingly well in the kinematic range considered. We
discuss also azimuthal correlations between outgoing particles. The azimuthal
distributions are not isotropic and are different for our standard model and
SPAs. We discuss also the possibility of a measurement of
two-photon-bremsstrahlung in the $pp \to pp \gamma \gamma$ reaction. In our
calculations we impose a cut on the relative energy loss ($0.02 < \xi_{i} <
0.1$, $i = 1,2$) of the protons where measurements by the ATLAS Forward Proton
(AFP) detectors are possible. The AFP requirement for both diffractively
scattered protons and one forward photon (measured at LHCf) reduces the cross
section for $p p \to p p \gamma$ almost to zero. On the other hand, much less
cross-section reduction occurs for $pp \to pp \gamma \gamma$ when photons are
emitted in opposite sides of the ATLAS interaction point and can be measured by
two different arms of LHCf. For the SPA1 ansatz we find $\sigma(pp \to pp
\gamma \gamma) \simeq 0.03$ nb at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and with the cuts $0.02 <
\xi_{i} < 0.1$, $8.5 < y_{3} < 9$, $-9 < y_{4} < -8.5$. Our predictions can be

the cms di-photon excess at 95 gev in view of the lhc run 2 results,"The CMS collaboration has recently reported the results of a low-mass
Higgs-boson search in the di-photon final state based on the full Run 2 data
set with refined analysis techniques. The new results show an excess of events
at a mass of about 95 GeV with a local significance of $2.9\,\sigma$,
confirming a previously reported excess at about the same mass and similar
significance based on the first-year Run 2 plus Run 1 data. The observed excess
is compatible with the limits obtained in the corresponding ATLAS searches. In
this work, we discuss the di-photon excess and show that it can be interpreted
as the lightest Higgs boson in the Two-Higgs doublet model that is extended by
a complex singlet (S2HDM) of Yukawa types II and IV. We show that the
second-lightest Higgs boson is in good agreement with the current LHC
Higgs-boson measurements of the state at 125 GeV, and that the full scalar
sector is compatible with all theoretical and experimental constraints.
Furthermore, we discuss the di-photon excess in conjunction with an excess in
the $b \bar b$ final state observed at LEP and an excess observed by CMS in the
di-tau final state, which were found at comparable masses with local
significances of about $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$, respectively. We find that the
$b \bar b$ excess can be well described together with the di-photon excess in
both types of the S2HDM. However, the di-tau excess can only be accommodated at
the level of $1\sigma$ in type IV. We also comment on the compatibility with
supersymmetric scenarios and other extended Higgs sectors, and we discuss how
the potential signal can be further analyzed at the LHC and at future $e^+e^-$

"asymmetric di-higgs signals of the next-to-minimal 2hdm with a $u(1)$
  symmetry","The two-Higgs-doublet model with a $U(1)_H$ gauge symmetry (N2HDM-$U(1)$) has
several advantages compared to the ``standard'' $Z_2$ version (N2HDM-$Z_2$): It
is purely based on gauge symmetries, involves only spontaneous symmetry
breaking, and is more predictive because it contains one parameter less in the
Higgs potential, which further ensures $CP$ conservation, i.e., avoiding the
stringent bounds from electric dipole moments. After pointing out that a
second, so far unknown version of the N2HDM-$U(1)$ exists, we examine the
phenomenological consequences for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the
differences in the scalar potentials. In particular, we find that while the
N2HDM-$Z_2$ predicts suppressed branching ratios for decays into different
Higgs bosons for the case of the small scalar mixing (as suggested by Higgs
coupling measurements), both versions of the N2HDM-$U(1)$ allow for sizable
rates. This is particularly relevant in light of the CMS excess in resonant
Higgs-pair production at around $650\,$GeV of a Standard Model Higgs boson
subsequently decaying to photons and a new scalar with a mass of
$\approx90\,$GeV subsequently decaying to bottom quarks (i.e., compatible with

"on production of excited kaluza-klein states in large radius
  compactification scenario","Production of exotic states at LHC is considered in the large radius
compactification scenario. We envisage a five dimensional theory for a scalar
field in five dimensional flat spacetime. It is compactified on a circle,
$S^1$, with radius, $R$. The radius is assumed to be in TeV scale appealing to
LRC hypothesis. The production of Kaluza-Klein states whose masses lie in the
vicinity of TeV range is considered. Instead of appealing to any specific
model, bounds on inelastic cross sections and near forward differental cross
section are derived from the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann (LSZ) formulation. We
consider decompactified theory should compactification radius be large enough
to unravel the fifth spacial dimension in LHC energy scale. Bounds on cross
sections are also derived for this scenario. We present bounds on inclusive
cross sections for reactions like $a+b\rightarrow c+X$, X being unobserved
states. We plot the bounds as a function of energy and propose that these
bounds might be useful for search of exotic states in LHC experiments like

"collider constraints on electroweakinos in the presence of a light
  gravitino","Using the GAMBIT global fitting framework, we constrain the MSSM with an
eV-scale gravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle, and the six
electroweakinos (neutralinos and charginos) as the only other light new states.
We combine 15 ATLAS and 12 CMS searches at 13\,TeV, along with a large
collection of ATLAS and CMS measurements of Standard Model signatures. This
model, which we refer to as the $\tilde G$-EWMSSM, exhibits quite varied
collider phenomenology due to its many permitted electroweakino production
processes and decay modes. Characteristic $\tilde G$-EWMSSM signal events have
two or more Standard Model bosons and missing energy due to the escaping
gravitinos. While much of the $\tilde G$-EWMSSM parameter space is excluded, we
find several viable parameter regions that predict phenomenologically rich
scenarios with multiple neutralinos and charginos within the kinematic reach of
the LHC during Run 3, or the High Luminosity LHC. In particular, we identify
scenarios with Higgsino-dominated electroweakinos as light as 140 GeV that are
consistent with our combined set of collider searches and measurements. The

high invariant-mass in the Drell-Yan process on probes of semileptonic
four-fermion operators in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT). In
particular, we study whether AFB measurements can resolve degeneracies in the
Wilson coefficient parameter space that appear when considering invariant-mass
and rapidity measurements alone. We perform detailed fits of the available
high-energy and high-luminosity ATLAS and CMS data for both invariant-mass
distributions and AFB. While each type of measurement separately exhibits
degeneracies, combining them removes these blind spots in some cases. In other
situations it does not, highlighting the importance of incorporating future
datasets from other experiments to fully explore this sector of the SMEFT. We
investigate the impact of contributions quadratic in the Wilson coefficients on
the description of Drell-Yan data and discuss when such terms are important in

"exciting ions: a systematic treatment of ultraperipheral heavy ion
  collisions with nuclear breakup","We present an updated theoretical treatment of ultraperipheral collisions
(UPCs) of heavy ions, within the SuperChic Monte Carlo generator. This in
particular accounts for mutual ion excitation through additional photon
exchanges between the colliding ions. This effect occurs frequently in UPCs,
and indeed can be (and has been) measured in data through the use of zero
degree calorimeter (ZDC) detectors installed in the far forward region. The
theoretical approach presented here accounts for the non-trivial and
non-negligible impact such ion dissociation has on the measured cross sections
and distributions of the produced particles in the central detectors. This
builds on previous work, whereby the survival factor probability of no
additional inelastic ion-ion scattering due to the strong interaction, and its
kinematic impact, are also accounted for within the same overall framework. We
compare to data from ATLAS and CMS at the LHC, and STAR at RHIC, and find in
general encouraging agreement for a range of observables and ZDC neutron tags,
with some room for further improvement, suggesting the inclusion of higher
order QED effects and/or tuning of the the $\gamma A \to A^*$ cross section may
be desirable. Overall, this gives confidence in the approach considered here

"accommodating hints of new heavy scalars in the framework of the
  flavor-aligned two-higgs-doublet model","Searches for new neutral Higgs bosons of an extended Higgs sector at the LHC
can be interpreted in the framework of the two-Higgs doublet model. By
employing generic flavor-aligned Higgs-fermion Yukawa couplings, we propose an
analysis that uses experimental data to determine whether flavor alignment is a
consequence of a symmetry that is either exact or at most softly broken. We
illustrate our proposal in two different scenarios based on a few 3 sigma
(local) excesses observed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in their searches
for heavy scalars. In Scenario 1, an excess of events is interpreted as $A\to
ZH\to \ell^+\ell^- b\bar{b}$ (where $\ell=e$ or $\mu$), with the CP-odd and
CP-even neutral scalar masses given by $m_A=610$ GeV and $m_H=290$ GeV,
respectively. In Scenario 2, an excess of events in the production of
$t\bar{t}$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states is interpreted as decays of a CP-odd
scalar of mass $m_A=400$ GeV. Scenario 1 is consistent with Type-I Yukawa
interactions, which can arise in a 2HDM subject to a softly-broken
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ discrete symmetry. Scenario 2 is inconsistent with a
symmetry-based flavor alignment, but can be consistent with more general

cross section assuming direct production via gluon fusion. For the whole range
of masses we consider (90$\,$GeV to 200$\,$GeV), the observed limit on the
cross section turns out to be weaker than the expected one. Furthermore, at
$\approx95\,$GeV the limit is weakest and a new scalar decaying into a pair of
$W$ bosons (which subsequently decay leptonically) with a cross section
$\approx0.5\,$pb is preferred over the Standard Model hypothesis by $\gtrsim
2.5\,\sigma$. In light of the excesses in the $\gamma\gamma$, $\tau^+\tau^-$

in $pp \rightarrow S \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ with gluon-gluon fusion
production in the invariant mass range [0.2; 0.6] TeV, including all relevant
low and high energy constraints. The excess is reproduced taking into account
the new contributions from the scalar H, the pseudoscalar A, or both. In
particular, detailed numerical analyses favoured the solution with a
significant hierarchy among the vevs of the two Higgs doublets, $t_{\beta} \sim

sizable couplings to $\tau$ leptons. In this region of the parameter space, the

long-lived particle phenomenology in the 2hdm+$a$ model,"Higgs decays displaced from the primary interaction vertex represent a
striking experimental signature that is actively searched for by the ATLAS, CMS

context of the 2HDM+$a$ model if the mixing angle $\theta$ of the two CP-odd
weak spin-0 eigenstates is tiny and the dark matter (DM) sector is either
decoupled or kinematically inaccessible. Utilising two suitable benchmark
scenarios, we determine the constraints on the parameter space of the 2HDM+$a$
model that are set by the existing LHC searches for long-lived particles (LLPs)
in Higgs decays. We find that depending on the precise mass spectrum of the
spin-0 states, mixing angles $\theta$ in the ballpark of a few $10^{-8}$ to
$10^{-5}$ can be excluded based on LHC Run II data. This finding emphasises the
unique role that searches for displaced signatures can play in constraining the

radius ($R$) dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, for
broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. The primary focus of
this work has been the in-depth analysis of the high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets
and the quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed in the
Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}}$= 5.02 TeV for the most-central
(0-10\%) collisions. The nuclear modification factor is calculated for
inclusive jets to compare with the experimental results collected at the ATLAS

function of jet radius and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the observations are well
described by the JETSCAPE framework which is based on the hydrodynamic

"precision phenomenology with fiducial cross sections in the

triply differential in the di-lepton mass and rapidity as well as in the

fiducial phase space, defined by cuts on the individual lepton momenta and
rapidities. Based on the ATLAS triple-differential Drell-Yan measurement at
8~TeV, we perform a detailed investigation of the phenomenology of this process
based on state-of-the-art perturbative predictions in QCD and the electroweak
theory. Our results demonstrate the highly non-trivial interplay between
measurement variables and fiducial cuts, which leads to forbidden regions at
Born level, and induces sensitivity on extra particle emissions from higher
perturbative orders. We also investigate the sensitivity of the measurement on
parton distributions and electroweak parameters. We derive Standard-Model
theory predictions which combine NNLO QCD and NLO EW corrections and include

"kinked tracks from $œÉ^+$ baryons as a probe of light quark

information about the original quark energy and momentum. In a less obvious

for $b$ quarks, $\Lambda_c$ for $c$ quarks and $\Lambda$ for $s$ quarks. In
this paper we extend these proposals to $\Sigma^+$ baryons, which can provide
sensitivity to polarizations of $s$ and $u$ quarks. We analyze the various

uncovering tau leptons-enriched semi-visible jets at the lhc,"This Letter proposes a new signature for confining dark sectors at the Large
Hadron Collider. Under the assumption of a QCD-like hidden sector, hadronic
jets containing stable dark bound states could manifest in proton-proton
collisions. We present a simplified model with a $Z'$ boson yielding the
production of jets made up of dark bound states and subsequently leading to the
decays of those that are unstable to $\tau$ leptons and Standard Model quarks.
The resulting signature is characterised by non-isolated $\tau$ lepton pairs
inside semi-visible jets. We estimate the constraints on our model from
existing CMS and ATLAS analyses. We propose a set of variables that leverage
the leptonic content of the jet and exploit them in a supervised jet tagger to
enhance the signal-to-background separation. Furthermore, we discuss the
performance and limitations of current triggers for accessing sub-TeV $Z'$
masses, as well as possible strategies that can be adopted by experiments to
access such low mass regions. We estimate that with the currently available
triggers, a high mass search can claim a $5 \sigma$ discovery (exclusion) of
the $Z'$ boson with a mass up to 4.5TeV (5.5TeV) with the full Run2 data of the
LHC when the fraction of unstable dark hadrons decaying to $\tau$ lepton pairs
is around $50\%$, and with a coupling of the $Z'$ to right-handed up-type
quarks of 0.25. Furthermore, we show that, with new trigger strategies for
Run3, it may be possible to access $Z'$ masses down to 700 GeV, for which the
event topology is still composed of two resolved semi-visible jets.","{'Cesare Cazzaniga', 'Hugues Beauchesne', 'Tobias Fitschen', 'Annapaola de Cosa', 'Giovanni Grilli di Cortona', 'Caterina Doglioni', 'Ziyuan Zhou'}",2023-07-13T07:16:25Z,2022-12-22 08:00:47+00:00

benchmark our architectures against more traditional event classification
strategies, we perform a case study involving Higgs boson decays to tau
leptons. We find a 2.5 times increase in performance compared to a baseline
ATLAS analysis with engineered features. Our point cloud architectures can be
viewed as simplified versions of graph neural networks, where each particle in

probing displaced top quark signature at the lhc run 3,"In the context of prospective studies for searches of new physics at the LHC
Run 3, this paper investigates the relevance of using top quarks produced from
new long-lived particles, and detected in the tracker volume of the ATLAS and
CMS experiments. Such a signature, referred to as displaced top quarks, leads
to final states containing displaced vertices and a high multiplicity of
displaced jets and tracks, thanks to the top quark decays. Therefore, it is a
possible powerful tool for searching for new long-lived particles. Three
simplified models based on supersymmetry are explicitly designed for the study
of this signature. They differ according to the nature of the long-lived heavy
particle which produces at least one top quark: electrically neutral or
charged, coloured or non-coloured long-lived particle. For each model, a wide
region of parameter space, consistent with a reasonable number of displaced top
quarks decaying in a typical tracker volume has been probed. From this study,
promising benchmarks are defined and experimental guidelines are suggested.","{'Robin Ducrocq', 'Jeremy Andrea', 'Douja Darej', 'Eric Conte', 'Emery Nibigira', 'Daniel Bloch'}",2023-03-29T08:11:34Z,2022-12-13 15:57:16+00:00
the third peak structure in the double $j/œà$ spectrum,"Recently, the CMS and ATLAS collaborations have reported their $J/\psi J/\psi
$ and $J/\psi \psi^\prime$ invariant mass distributions, respectively, for
searching for fully charmed tetraquarks. Both of them reported the existence of
a peak structure around $7.2~\gev$. In this article, we exhibit the role of the
$\eta_c(2S)\eta_c(2S)$ channel, which is close to this peak position, by
studying the $J/\psi J/\psi $ and $J/\psi \psi^\prime$ invariant mass
distributions for the potential quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ or $2^{++}$ by
considering both the coherence and incoherence with the background
contribution. All these frameworks can describe the experimental data very
well, however with different pole structures. For instance, in the case of
$2^{++}$ description of these structures, there always exists a pole slightly
below the $J/\psi J/\psi$ threshold. For the $0^{++}$ case, a similar pole can
also be found below the $J/\psi J/\psi$ threshold however with a much lower
mass. More importantly, the number of the poles is found to be case-dependent.
For the $0^{++}$ ($2^{++}$) case, the peak structure around $7.2~\gev$ can
(cannot) be produced due to the presence (absence) of the
$\eta_c(2S)\eta_c(2S)$ channel. Although the pole positions are case-dependent,
the relation between the peak structure in the $J/\psi J/\psi$ invariant mass
distribution and the dip structure in the $J/\psi \psi^\prime$ invariant mass
distribution around $7.2~\gev$ is unambiguous. We suggest experimentalists to
detailed scan both the $J/\psi J/\psi$ and the $J/\psi \psi^\prime$ invariant
mass distributions, especially around $7.2~\gev$ to probe the nature of the
third fully charmed state.","{'Zhenyu Zhang', 'PengYu Niu', 'Qian Wang', 'Meng-Lin Du'}",2023-04-11T12:51:37Z,2022-12-13 12:40:27+00:00

at 95% confidence level. The combined single-Higgs and double-Higgs analyses
provide results with fewer assumptions, by adding in the fit more coupling

physics at collider experiments such as ATLAS and CMS at the LHC. Usually
predictions for this kind of process are obtained using mainly perturbative

VBS in the scalar-channel involving three different types of Higgs-like

fully-heavy tetraquark spectroscopy in the relativistic quark model,"Masses of the ground and excited (1P, 2S, 1D, 2P, 3S) states of the
fully-heavy tetraquarks, composed of charm ($c$) and bottom ($b$) quarks and
antiquarks, are calculated in the diquark-antidiquark picture within the
relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach and quantum
chromodynamics. The quasipotentials of the quark-quark and diquark-antidiquark
interactions are constructed similarly to the previous consideration of mesons
and baryons. Relativistic effects are consistently taken into account. A
tetraquark is considered as a bound state of a diquark and an antidiquark. The
finite size of the diquark is taken into account, using the form factors of the
diquark-gluon interaction. It is shown that most of the investigated states of
tetraquarks lie above the decay thresholds into a meson pair, as a result they
can be observed only as broad resonances. The narrow state X(6900) recently
discovered in the di-$J/\psi$ production spectrum by the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS
Collaborations corresponds to an excited state of the fully-charmed tetraquark.
Other recently discovered exotic heavy resonances X(6200), X(6400), X(6600),
X(7200), X(7300) can also be interpreted as the different excitations of the

developments in performance and portability for madgraph5_amc@nlo,"Event generators simulate particle interactions using Monte Carlo techniques,
providing the primary connection between experiment and theory in experimental
high energy physics. These software packages, which are the first step in the
simulation worflow of collider experiments, represent approximately 5 to 20% of
the annual WLCG usage for the ATLAS and CMS experiments. With computing
architectures becoming more heterogeneous, it is important to ensure that these
key software frameworks can be run on future systems, large and small. In this
contribution, recent progress on porting and speeding up the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO
event generator on hybrid architectures, i.e. CPU with GPU accelerators, is
discussed. The main focus of this work has been in the calculation of
scattering amplitudes and ""matrix elements"", which is the computational
bottleneck of an event generation application. For physics processes limited to
QCD leading order, the code generation toolkit has been expanded to produce
matrix element calculations using C++ vector instructions on CPUs and using
CUDA for NVidia GPUs, as well as using Alpaka, Kokkos and SYCL for multiple CPU
and GPU architectures. Performance is reported in terms of matrix element
calculations per time on NVidia, Intel, and AMD devices. The status and outlook

the current Fortran version, is also described.","{'Walter Hopkins', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Taylor Childers', 'Stefan Roiser', 'Andrea Valassi', 'Olivier Mattelaer', 'David Smith', 'Stefan Hageb√∂ck', 'Laurence Field'}",2022-10-20T09:33:17Z,2022-10-20 09:33:17+00:00
"optimizing higgs boson reconstruction efficiency with small-r (r = 0.4)
  and large-r (r = 1.0) jets","Many Beyond the Standard Model searches at ATLAS employ jets to simplify
event reconstruction. These jets cluster particle shower products into
calculable objects, which are then used to obtain information about parent
particles. Large-R (R = 1.0) jets combine these products into one jet that
spans 2 radians, while small-R (R = 0.4) jets are used to further refine
individual b-quark trajectories. Optimizing the use of jets is crucial for
making precision measurements of Higgs bosons with high transverse momenta, and
this paper uses b-quarks produced in the Wino chargino LSP decay to identify
parameters that best do so. Monte Carlo simulation found that parameters such
as the distance between Higgs bosons and the distance between b-jets were
relevant in selecting the most accurate small-R reconstructions. Truth data
analysis corroborated the paper's findings, especially for charginos with
higher mass. These parameters were then used to refine small-R jet selection,
increasing reconstruction efficiency across chargino masses. Further analysis
into large-R jet selection would enhance these results, especially at higher
chargino masses. A neural network would also prove useful for exploring the
effects of combinations of parameters across chargino masses.","{'Evelyn Thomson', 'Sophie Kadan'}",2023-03-04T23:00:16Z,2022-10-17 14:00:55+00:00
"the radiative flavor template at the lhc: lepton non-universality and
  g-2","The Standard Model of Particle Physics and its description of Nature have
been recently challenged by a series of precision measurements performed via
different accelerator machines. Statistically significant anomalies emerged in
the heavy meson physics sector, when measuring the muon magnetic momentum, and
very recently when deducing the mass of the W boson. Here we consider a
radiative extension of the Standard Model devised to be sufficiently versatile
to reconcile the various experimental results while further predicting the
existence of new bosons and fermions with a mass spectrum in the TeV energy
scale. The resulting spectrum is, therefore, within the energy reach of the
proton-proton collisions at the LHC experiments at CERN. The model investigated
here allows to interpolate between composite and elementary extensions of the
Standard Model with emphasis on a new modified Yukawa sector that is needed to
accommodate the anomalies. Focusing on the radiative regime of the model, we
introduce interesting search channels of immediate impact for the ATLAS and CMS
experimental programs such as the associate production of Standard Model
particles with either invisible or long-lived particles. We further show how to
adapt earlier SUSY-motivated searchers of new physics to constrain the spectrum
and couplings of the new scalars and fermions. Overall, the new physics
template simultaneously accounts for the bulk of the observed experimental
anomalies while suggesting a wide spectrum of experimental signatures relevant
for the current LHC experiments.","{'Giacomo Cacciapaglia', 'Francesco Carnevali', 'Alberto Orso Maria Iorio', 'Francesco Sannino', 'Roberta Calabrese', 'Agostino De Iorio', 'Stefano Morisi', 'Antimo Cagnotta'}",2023-04-19T16:24:35Z,2022-10-13 16:15:28+00:00

"the higgs condensate as a quantum liquid: a critical comparison with
  observations","The triviality of four-dimensional scalar quantum field theories poses
challenging problems to the usually adopted perturbative implementation of the
Higgs mechanism. In the first part of the paper we compare the triviality
scenario and the renormalised two-loop perturbation theory to precise and
extensive results from non-perturbative numerical simulations of the real
scalar field theory on the lattice. The proposal of triviality and spontaneous
symmetry breaking turns out to be in good agreement with numerical simulations,
while the renormalised perturbative approach seems to suffer significant
deviations from the numerical simulation results. In the second part of the
paper we try to illustrate how the triviality of four-dimensional scalar field
theory leads, nevertheless, to the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the scalar
sector of the Standard Model. We show how triviality allows us to develop a
physical picture of the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model. We suggest that
the Higgs condensate behave like a relativistic quantum liquid leading to the
prevision of two Higgs bosons. The light Higgs boson resembles closely the new
LHC narrow resonance at 125 GeV. The heavy Higgs boson is a rather broad
resonance with mass of about 730 GeV. We critically compare our proposal to the
complete LHC Run 2 data collected by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. We do
not find convincingly evidences of the heavy Higgs boson in the ATLAS datasets.
On the other hand, the CMS full Run 2 data display evidences of a heavy Higgs
boson in the main decay modes $H \rightarrow WW$, while in the preliminary Run
2 data there are hints of the decays $H \rightarrow ZZ$ in the golden channel.

"study of corrections for anomalous coupling limits due to the possible
  background bsm contributions","The search of the anomalous couplings is one of the possible ways to find any
deviation from the Standard Model. The effective field theory is used to
parameterize the anomalous couplings in the Lagrangian with the operators of
higher dimensions, constructed from the SM fields. In the classical way, the
limits on the Wilson coefficients of these operators are set based on beyond
the Standard Model contributions induced for signal process, whereas the ones
induced for background processes are assumed to be negligible. This article
provides a study of the corrections to the limits on Wilson coefficients by
accounting beyond the Standard Model contributions induced for background
processes. The studies of $Z(\nu\bar{\nu})\gamma jj$ and $W(\ell\nu)\gamma jj$
productions in $pp$ collisions with $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and conditions of the

operator) tighter than the classical ones respectively. Corrected combined

achieved for any collider process, and we study in detail the impact of
different choices in the combination of QCD and EW corrections as well as QCD

retained by considering the full leptonic processes $pp \to
\ell^+\ell^-\ell'^\pm \nu_\ell'$ with $\ell'\neq\ell$ and $\ell'=\ell$ without
approximations, and the matching to QED radiation is performed preserving the
resonance structure of the process. We find that NNLO QCD predictions including
